- Customers can't articulate their process (use observation)

🚩 **Don't use skill-creator-pro when:**
- Task is truly one-off
- Process is standard and well-documented elsewhere
- You're not willing to follow TDD discipline

🚩 **Don't use opportunity-solution-tree when:**
- Outcome isn't clear yet
- Team isn't bought into continuous discovery
- You're in execution mode (not discovery)

## The Bottom Line

**Start with the skill that matches your immediate need.**

Don't try to learn all 11 at once. Pick one, use it on real work, see results. Then add another.

The skills compound: each one you learn makes the others more powerful. JTBD research informs better positioning. Customer empathy makes better copywriting. Outcome discovery feeds opportunity trees.

**Trust the frameworks.** These skills codify decades of proven methodology from April Dunford, Teresa Torres, Marty Cagan, Patrick Campbell, and others. Follow them even when your instinct says otherwise—especially when you're learning.

**Use skill-creator-pro to create your own.** The goal isn't to use these 11 skills forever. It's to learn the pattern and build your own library of company-specific, domain-specific skills.

That's how you create a competitive moat: not through better AI models, but through better process knowledge.
