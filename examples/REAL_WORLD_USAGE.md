## Common Patterns Across Cases

### Pattern 1: Skills Work Best Together

**Examples:**
- positioning + customer-empathy + copywriting
- jtbd-research + continuous-discovery-interview + job-mapping + outcome-discovery
- pricing-survey-create + pricing-synthetic-panel + pricing-survey-analyze

**Why:**
- Output of one skill = input to another
- Complete workflow, not isolated techniques
- Compound value

### Pattern 2: Skills Enforce Discipline Under Pressure

**Examples:**

- Expert knowledge codified in steps
- Failure modes documented
- No need to read entire book first

### Pattern 4: Skills Save Time Through Consistency

**Examples:**
- 12 JTBD interviews following same structure (continuous-discovery-interview)
- 5 company skills created following same process (skill-creator-pro)
- Team aligned on positioning in 1 week vs months (positioning)

**Why:**
- No reinventing process each time
- Consistent application = comparable results
- Onboarding faster

### Pattern 5: Skills Enable Iteration

**Examples:**
- Pricing research repeated quarterly (pricing-survey-create)
- Customer interviews as weekly habit (continuous-discovery-interview)
- OST updated monthly (opportunity-solution-tree)

**Why:**
- Documented process = repeatable
- No "how did we do this last time?"
- Continuous improvement built in
