# Continuous Discovery Interview

Conduct effective story-based customer interviews that reveal actual customer behavior, not perceived behavior.

## When to Use

- Weekly as part of continuous discovery cadence
- Exploring a new outcome or opportunity space
- Understanding "why" behind quantitative data
- Validating opportunities discovered through other means
- Before generating solutions (discover problems first)
- When stakeholders ask "what do customers want?"

## Core Principle

**Don't ask what customers want. Ask them to tell stories about their experiences.**

Direct questions fail because:
- People answer based on ideal self, not actual behavior
- Cognitive biases distort self-reporting
- "Left brain interpreter" fabricates coherent but false explanations
- Confidence doesn't equal truth

Stories about recent, specific experiences reveal actual behavior.

## The Process

### 1. Prepare Research Questions

**Define what you're trying to learn** (internal, don't ask directly):
- What opportunities matter most to this customer?
- What are their needs/pain points/desires around [topic]?
- How do they currently address [need]?

**Balance broad exploration with targeted depth:**
- Start broad: What matters most to them?
- Then dive into specifics relevant to your work

### 2. Craft Story Questions

Transform research questions into story prompts:

**❌ Direct question:** "What criteria do you use when buying jeans?"  
**✅ Story question:** "Tell me about the last time you bought a pair of jeans."

**❌ Direct question:** "How often do you use our app?"  
**✅ Story question:** "Tell me about the last time you used our app."

**Scope your question based on what you need:**

| Need | Scope | Example |
|------|-------|---------|
| Optimize existing product | Narrow | "Tell me about the last time you used [feature]" |
| Understand competitive landscape | Medium | "Tell me about the last time you [did activity] with any tool" |
| Explore new markets | Broad | "Tell me about the last time you [achieved outcome]" |

### 3. Set Interview Expectations

At the start:
> "I'd like you to share your full story with as many details as possible. Leave nothing out. When you're done, I'll ask for any missing details."

This resets conversational norms from 50/50 back-and-forth to storytelling mode.

### 4. Ask the Story Question

Start with your primary story prompt.

Example: "Tell me about the last time you watched streaming entertainment."

### 5. Excavate the Story

Most participants will give short answers initially:
> "I watched The Good Place last night after dinner."

That's not a story yet. Guide them through the full experience.

**Use temporal prompts:**
- "Start at the beginning. What happened first?"
- "What happened next?"
- "What happened before that?"
- "Walk me through the whole experience"

**Use context prompts:**
- "Where were you? Set the scene for me."
- "Who was with you?"
- "What were you thinking/feeling at that moment?"
- "What challenges did you encounter?"
- "How did you overcome that?"
- "Did anyone help you?"

**Use your experience map** (if you have one) to track the story and prompt for missing nodes.

### 6. Keep Them in the Story

Participants will try to generalize:
- "I usually..."
- "In general, I..."
- "I always..."

**Gently redirect to the specific instance:**
- "In this specific example, did you face that challenge?"
- "What happened in THIS case?"
- "Let's stick with that specific time..."

### 7. Respect What They Care About

**The Golden Rule:** Let participants talk about what THEY care about most.

You have two ways to steer:
1. **Story scope** - Broad vs narrow initial question
2. **Story prompts** - Which parts you dig into

But if they don't cooperate:
- Don't have a relevant story
- Want to talk about different part of story
- Give one-sentence answers
- Want to share feature ideas

**Don't force it.** Capture what value they're willing to share. You'll interview another customer next week.

### 8. Create Interview Snapshot

Immediately after the interview (while fresh), create a one-page snapshot:

**Include:**
- Participant quick facts (role, context, demographics)
- Key stories told
- Opportunities discovered (needs, pain points, desires)
- Notable quotes
- Next research questions raised
- Date and interviewer

**Purpose:**
- Turn notes into insights
- Create searchable reference library
- Prevent relying on memory
- Enable team to reference specific stories

## Deliverable

**Interview snapshot** - One-pager that synthesizes:
- Who you talked to
- What stories they shared
- What opportunities you discovered
- What you still need to learn

## Common Mistakes

1. **Asking direct questions** - "What do you want?" "How often?"
2. **Accepting generalizations** - Letting "I usually" replace specific stories
3. **Forcing your agenda** - Not respecting participant's priorities
4. **Skipping snapshot creation** - Missing synthesis step
5. **Interviewing too infrequently** - Monthly isn't continuous
6. **Only PM interviews** - Whole trio should participate
7. **No outcome focus** - Interviewing without purpose

## Example Workflow

**Scenario:** You're working on a streaming entertainment service. Outcome: Increase weekly viewer minutes.

**1. Research Questions:**
- What matters most to viewers when choosing what to watch?
- What challenges do they face in our viewing experience?
- What entertainment competes with our service?

**2. Story Question:**
"Tell me about the last time you watched any streaming entertainment."

**3. Participant Response:**
"I watched Stranger Things on Netflix last Friday."

**4. Excavate:**
- "Start at the beginning. What made you decide to watch something?"
- "How did you choose Stranger Things?"
- "What happened first?"
- "Walk me through finding it and starting to watch."
- "What challenges did you face?"
- "How long did you watch?"
- "What made you stop?"

**5. Redirect Generalizations:**
Participant: "I usually scroll forever and can't decide..."
You: "In this specific case last Friday, what happened when you were choosing?"

**6. Discovered Opportunities:**
- Deciding what to watch takes too long
- Don't know what's new/available
- Fell asleep, lost place in series
- Want to watch offline (was traveling)

**7. Snapshot Created:**
One-pager with participant info, full story summary, opportunities identified, follow-up questions.

## Tips for Success

### Before Interview
- Define research questions (what you need to learn)
- Prepare broad story prompt
- Review experience map (if available)
- Clear schedule for snapshot creation after

### During Interview
- Set storytelling expectation upfront
- Use temporal and context prompts liberally
- Track story on experience map
- Redirect generalizations gently
- Take detailed notes
- Note emotional moments (opportunities lurk there)

### After Interview
- Create snapshot immediately (within hour)
- Extract opportunities explicitly
- Note what you still need to learn
- Share with trio to maintain shared understanding

### Building the Habit
- Start with one interview per week minimum
- Rotate who conducts (but all can observe)
- Create snapshot template to streamline
- Build library of snapshots for reference
- Refine story prompts based on what works

## Quality Indicators

**Good interview:**
✅ Participant shared 2+ specific, detailed stories  
✅ Discovered opportunities you didn't expect  
✅ Understand their context and challenges  
✅ Story revealed actual behavior (not ideal)  
✅ Can picture the experience happening

**Poor interview (but that's okay):**
❌ One-word answers  
❌ Only generalizations, no specific instances  
❌ Participant only wanted to share feature ideas  
❌ No relevant stories  
❌ Off-topic discussion

With continuous interviewing, bad interviews are forgettable. Talk to someone new next week.
