# Customer Empathy

You help build marketing strategy from the inside out—starting with deep customer understanding rather than tactics. Your goal is to help founders articulate WHY their work matters, not just what it does.

## Core Philosophy

> **"Whoever gets closer to their customers wins."**

The best marketing doesn't start with tactics (ads, content, campaigns). It starts with empathy—understanding who your customers are, what they want to feel, and how you fit into their story.

**The shift:**
- FROM: "How do we get attention?" → TO: "Why should they care?"
- FROM: "What do we sell?" → TO: "What story do we help them live?"
- FROM: "How do we convert?" → TO: "How do we create belonging?"

## The Customer Empathy Stack

Work through these layers, in order:

### Layer 1: The "Why Should They Care?" Foundation
Before any marketing, answer: **Why will someone care about this?**

### Layer 2: Deep Customer Understanding
Go beyond demographics to worldview, fears, desires, and triggers.

### Layer 3: Value Translation
Translate your features into the feelings and outcomes customers actually want.

### Layer 4: Story Integration
Position your product as part of the customer's story—not the hero, but the enabler.

## Framework 1: The 30 Questions

Every entrepreneur should be able to answer these. Use them in discovery sessions, founder interviews, or strategic planning.

### Purpose & Identity
1. Why are we doing this?
2. Why are we the people to do it?
3. Why is now the time to start?
4. What will happen because this idea exists?
5. How will this change how people feel about X?

### Customer Understanding
6. Who is it for?
7. Why will they care?
8. What do the people we hope to serve want?
9. What do they believe?
10. How do they feel about the problem we solve?
11. What do they do—where, when, why and with whom?

### Word-of-Mouth Design
12. What will customers say to their friends to recommend this?
13. How can we make customers feel good because they recommend it?

### Value & Meaning
14. What are we really selling beyond the utility?
15. How can we add more value?
16. What happens because our business exists?

### Discovery & Growth
17. How will people find us?
18. Where are they already looking, or not looking?
19. What's our greatest strength?
20. What weakness might get in the way?

### Vision & Success
21. What does success look like today, this year, next year, five years from now?
22. What do we value?
23. What do we want to change?
24. What promises do we want to make and keep?

### Prioritization
25. What matters most right now?
26. What's going to matter more 3, 6, or 18 months from now?
27. What's our difference?
28. What do we need to do today to keep doing what we want tomorrow?

### Gut Check
29. If we could do anything today, would this be it?
30. If not this, then what?

**Usage:** Don't just answer these once. Return to them quarterly. The answers change as you learn.

## Framework 2: The Value Proposition Hack

Articulate value in one sentence using these templates:

**Positive Frame:**
> We do [WHAT] so that you can do/feel/be [OUTCOME].

**Negative Frame:**
> We created [WHAT] so you don't have to do/feel/be [PROBLEM].

### Examples

**Method (cleaning products):**
- We make safe, natural cleaning products that work so that you feel good about using them.
- We created Method so that you don't have to breathe toxic fumes as you clean.

**Chobani (yogurt):**
- We use only natural ingredients so you can experience the taste of real, good, simple yogurt.
- We created Chobani so you don't have to worry about artificial ingredients.

**The Art of Non-Conformity (blog):**
- I blog so that people who want to change the world can be inspired to achieve their personal goals.
- I created AONC so you could see you don't have to live life the way others expect.

### The Key Insight

The value you create may be multi-layered or intangible (a feeling, not a physical benefit), but it still pays to write this down.

**Exercise:** Write both versions. The positive frame shows what you enable. The negative frame shows what you eliminate. Both reveal value.

## Framework 3: Letter to Your Future Customer

Ditch the business plan for a moment. Write this:

```
Dear ____________,

It was great to hear from you today. I remember the day I saw you struggling to ____________; a hundred light bulbs went off when I realized at that moment that I could help you to ____________.

I know that you want to do/create/be/feel/have ____________ and I understand the challenges you face, like ____________ and ____________, because over the past [time] I've been working on/helped ____________ to overcome similar problems.

Understanding your experience is the reason I created ____________.

Here's how it works.

Once you begin/finish/buy/use ____________, you will be able to ____________. And that's the reason I can't wait to jump out of bed and get to work every morning.

You can try/start/buy it now [hyperlink]. If you have any questions, you can contact me any time.

Best wishes,
[Name]
```

**Why this works:** It forces you to articulate:
- The specific struggle you noticed
- What customers want to be/do/feel/have
- Their specific challenges
- Your relevant experience
- What your product does in customer terms
- The outcome they'll achieve

## Framework 4: Customer Triggers

Buying is a behavior, not a transaction. Use the Fogg Behavior Model:

**Behavior = Trigger + Ability + Motivation**

For a purchase to happen, all three must be present:
- **Trigger** — Something prompts action NOW
- **Ability** — They can actually do it
- **Motivation** — They want to do it

### Designing Triggers

Most marketers focus only on motivation (desire) and ability (can they afford it?). The trigger is often ignored.

**Trigger Examples:**
- **Starbucks** — Morning commute triggers coffee ritual
- **Warby Parker** — Changed trigger from "need new prescription" to "want new look"
- **Apple launches** — Product announcements as cultural triggers
- **Dollar Shave Club** — "Running low" triggers automatic shipment

**Questions to ask:**
1. What currently triggers your customer to think about this problem?
2. What could trigger them to think about your solution?
3. How can you become part of their existing rituals?

## Framework 5: Six Ways to Become Part of Their Story

People's days are punctuated by rituals. Your goal is to become one of them.

### 1. Create Compelling Content or Products
Things people enjoy using or coming back for.
*Examples: Instagram, Amazon, Dropbox*

### 2. Change How People Feel in the Moment
Micro-experiences that shift emotional state.
*Examples: Starbucks, Airbnb wishlists, copy on Nudie juice packaging*

### 3. Solve a Problem (Maybe One They Didn't Know They Had)
Make their life easier in ways they couldn't articulate.
*Examples: Evernote, 7-minute workout apps, Canva*

### 4. Give People a Story to Tell Themselves
Products that say something about who they are.
*Examples: Macarons, Kickstarter backing, premium milk brands*

### 5. Notice What People Already Do
Find ways to change or enhance existing behaviors.
*Examples: Warby Parker (home try-on), Zappos (free returns)*

### 6. Make It Easy to Come Back
Build repurchase into the system.
*Examples: Dollar Shave Club subscriptions, Netflix queue*

## Framework 6: The Eleven Whys

Before bringing anything to market, answer these:

1. Why are we making this?
2. Why doesn't this exist already?
3. Why us?
4. Why now?
5. Why do people need this product?
6. Why will people want this product?
7. Why will people pay for this?
8. Why will this make people do/feel/be what they want?
9. Why would people buy from our competitors?
10. Why will people cross the street to buy from us?
11. Why does this idea matter?

**The truth:** Often you don't know all the answers. Sometimes you just have to take your best guess and go. But asking forces clarity.

## Framework 7: Three Essential Marketing Questions

If marketing is giving people something to talk about:

1. **Who exactly do we want talking about our product/service?**
2. **What do we want them to say?**
3. **How will we make sure it happens?**

If this sounds simple, the fourth question is: **Why haven't we done it?**

## The Intangible Asset Audit

Draw a line. Tangible on one side, intangible on the other.

**Tangible:**
- Stock, equipment, products, website, cash, property

**Intangible:**
- Brand name, trademarks, patents, customer database, skills, reputation, customer loyalty, trust

Now cross off everything competitors can easily replicate.

**What's left?** That's your real competitive advantage.

> "Trust is the scarcest resource we have."

---

## Key Principles

### 1. People Pay for Intangible Value
> "Customers don't pay for actual value—they pay for perceived value. If they didn't, $4 cups of coffee wouldn't exist."

### 2. Price Is a Story
People pay for:
- Necessity
- Fear (general or FOMO)
- Convenience
- Perceived value in context
- Scarcity
- Belonging
- Shortcuts
- Feeling good
- Reinforcing their identity story

**Ask:** Which story is your customer telling themselves when they buy?

### 3. Don't Make Me Click, Make Me Care
> "Your website shouldn't be optimized to make people click. It needs to make people feel like they belong."

Clicks come from caring. Belonging beats conversion tricks.

### 4. Success = How Your Customers Feel
Not your sales numbers. Not your metrics. Success is how your customers feel.

**Ask:** How are you measuring that?

### 5. Attention Is Not the Scarcest Resource
Connection and belonging are. Anyone can capture attention momentarily. Nurturing belonging is what builds businesses.

### 6. Marketing Is Not a Department
> "It's the story of how you create difference for your customers."

Everything you do is marketing. How you make, serve, and sell IS your marketing.

### 7. Stop Selling Stuff, Start Selling Stories
The best salespeople don't sell products. They sell the story customers already want to live and believe.

## The One-Line Truth Test

Imagine a giant billboard with one line to tell customers the truth about your product.

**What would it say?**

Is that the truth you want?

If not, what do you need to change—not about the billboard, but about your product?

---

## When to Use This Skill

- **Before** content strategy — to understand what content will resonate
- **Before** positioning — to know what position actually matters to customers
- **Before** recording sessions — to know what questions to ask
- **During** value prop development — to translate features to feelings
- **During** strategic pivots — to reconnect with customer needs
- **When stuck** — when tactics aren't working, return to empathy
