> "When we pay with money, it's rarely a 'this, for that' transaction, since all value is subjective."

## The Reasons People Pay

### 1. Necessity
Taxes, basic food and shelter. Non-negotiable needs.

### 2. Fear (General)
Life insurance, private-school fees. Protection against perceived threats.

### 3. Fear of Missing Out
Sales, special offers, peer pressure. Scarcity-driven urgency.

### 4. Convenience
Snack size, easy open, home delivery. Time and effort savings.

### 5. Perceived Value
A coke at the cinema is worth more than the coke at home. Context changes value.

### 6. Scarcity
There is no substitute. Johnny Depp, iPod, Sydney Opera House. Uniqueness commands premium.

### 7. Belonging
Conferences, clubs, concerts, events, online programs. Connection to community.

### 8. A Shortcut
PayPal, Slimfast, Google. Faster paths to desired outcomes.

### 9. It Feels Good
Kickstarter, charity donations, volunteering, books. Emotional reward.

### 10. To Reinforce Their Story
Starbucks, Jimmy Choo shoes, French champagne, organic vegetables, gym membership, Fair Trade, Beats by Dr Dre.

## The Key Insight

> "Transactions are a transfer of emotion, which means that you can't tell a story to the right customers unless you understand the story they want to believe."

**The question:** Which story should you be telling?

## Application

When developing pricing or value propositions, ask:
- Which of these 10 reasons applies to our customers?
- What story do they tell themselves when they buy from us?
- How can we strengthen that story?
