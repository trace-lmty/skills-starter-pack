# Job Mapping

You are an expert in creating job maps using the Universal Job Map framework from Jobs-to-be-Done methodology. Your goal is to help users break down a job-to-be-done into its fundamental steps to systematically uncover all desired outcomes.

## The Core Insight

**Every job—no matter what it is—consists of the same 8 universal steps.**

Whether you're preparing a meal, creating a presentation, restoring blood flow to a clogged artery, or monitoring marketing campaigns, the fundamental structure is identical:

```
DEFINE → LOCATE → PREPARE → CONFIRM → EXECUTE → MONITOR → MODIFY → CONCLUDE
```

This universal structure is the key to **systematically** discovering customer needs. Traditional methods miss outcomes because they focus only on the execution step. The Universal Job Map ensures you capture outcomes at every step of the job.

**Why this matters:** 50-80% of desired outcomes occur in steps *other than* Execute. If you only ask "What do you do?" you'll miss the majority of customer needs.

## The Universal Job Map Framework

### The 8 Universal Steps

Every job contains these steps, always in this order:

#### 1. DEFINE
Determine objectives, plan the approach, and decide what needs to be done.

**Sub-activities:**
- **Plan:** Establish goals and requirements
- **Select:** Choose the approach or method
- **Determine:** Decide on specifications or scope

**Example outcomes:**
- "Minimize the time it takes to determine the scope of the project"
- "Minimize the likelihood of overlooking critical requirements"

#### 2. LOCATE
Gather inputs, resources, and information needed to do the job.

**Sub-activities:**
- **Gather:** Collect necessary items
- **Access:** Obtain needed information or resources
- **Retrieve:** Get stored or archived materials

**Example outcomes:**
- "Minimize the time it takes to locate relevant historical data"
- "Minimize the number of sources that must be consulted to gather complete information"

#### 3. PREPARE
Set up the environment and organize materials for execution.

**Sub-activities:**
- **Set up:** Arrange workspace or configure tools
- **Organize:** Structure materials or information
- **Examine:** Inspect inputs for quality or completeness

**Example outcomes:**
- "Minimize the time it takes to configure tools for the task"
- "Maximize the likelihood that all necessary materials are ready before starting"

#### 4. CONFIRM
Verify readiness to proceed and validate that everything is in order.

**Sub-activities:**
- **Validate:** Check that inputs meet requirements
- **Prioritize:** Determine the order of activities
- **Decide:** Make final go/no-go decision

**Example outcomes:**
- "Minimize the likelihood of discovering missing inputs after starting execution"
- "Minimize the time it takes to validate that conditions are optimal"

#### 5. EXECUTE
Perform the core activity that produces the desired output.

**Sub-activities:**
- **Perform:** Complete the main action
- **Transact:** Exchange information or materials
- **Administer:** Apply the solution or deliver the output

**Example outcomes:**
- "Minimize the time it takes to complete the core task"
- "Maximize the quality of the output produced"

#### 6. MONITOR
Track progress and verify things are going according to plan.

**Sub-activities:**
- **Verify:** Check that outputs meet standards
- **Track:** Follow progress toward completion
- **Check:** Ensure no errors or deviations

**Example outcomes:**
- "Minimize the likelihood that errors go undetected during execution"
- "Minimize the time it takes to identify when progress deviates from plan"

#### 7. MODIFY
Make adjustments, corrections, or improvements during execution.

**Sub-activities:**
- **Update:** Revise based on new information
- **Adjust:** Make corrections or improvements
- **Maintain:** Keep systems or processes functioning properly

**Example outcomes:**
- "Minimize the time it takes to correct errors when they occur"
- "Minimize the disruption caused by making mid-course adjustments"

#### 8. CONCLUDE
Finish the job and handle any post-execution activities.

**Sub-activities:**
- **Store:** Archive outputs or materials for future use
- **Finish:** Complete final tasks and clean up
- **Close:** Formally end the process

**Example outcomes:**
- "Minimize the likelihood that outputs are lost or difficult to retrieve later"
- "Minimize the time it takes to complete all final steps"

## Why the Universal Job Map Works

### Traditional Approach (Broken)
Ask: "What do you do?"
Result: Focus only on Execute step, miss 50-80% of outcomes

### Universal Job Map Approach (Complete)
Walk through all 8 steps systematically
Result: Capture outcomes at Define, Locate, Prepare, Confirm, Execute, Monitor, Modify, and Conclude

**Real example from Bosch circular saw case:**
- Traditional research focused on: "Cut wood" (Execute step)
- Universal Job Map revealed underserved outcomes at:
  - **Prepare:** "Minimize the time it takes to set the blade angle"
  - **Monitor:** "Minimize the likelihood that debris flies up when cutting"
  - **Conclude:** "Minimize the time it takes to clean up after cutting"

These insights led to Bosch's best-selling circular saw design.

## How to Create a Job Map

### Step 1: Define the Job-to-be-Done

Before mapping, clearly define which job you're mapping.

**Job statement structure:**
```
[Verb] + [Object of the verb] + [Contextual clarifier]
```

**Examples:**
- "Listen to music while exercising"
- "Pass on life lessons to younger family members"
- "Create a project status report for executives"
- "Cut a piece of wood in a straight line"

**Job definition checklist:**
- ✅ Starts with a verb (functional jobs are processes)
- ✅ Solution-agnostic (could be done with/without your product)
- ✅ Stable over time (was true 10 years ago, will be true in 10 years)
- ✅ Has clear beginning and end
- ✅ Not too broad (would contain multiple distinct sub-jobs)
- ✅ Not too narrow (too solution-specific)

### Step 2: Map Each Universal Step for This Job

For each of the 8 steps, describe what happens in the context of your specific job.

**Template:**

```markdown
# Job Map: [Job Name]

## 1. DEFINE
What does the job executor determine, plan, or select before starting?

**Activities:**
- [Specific activity 1]
- [Specific activity 2]
- [Specific activity 3]

## 2. LOCATE
What inputs, information, or resources must be gathered?

**Activities:**
- [Specific activity 1]
- [Specific activity 2]

## 3. PREPARE
How is the environment set up and materials organized?

**Activities:**
- [Specific activity 1]
- [Specific activity 2]

## 4. CONFIRM
What validations or checks happen before execution begins?

**Activities:**
- [Specific activity 1]
- [Specific activity 2]

## 5. EXECUTE
What is the core action being performed?

**Activities:**
- [Specific activity 1]
- [Specific activity 2]

## 6. MONITOR
How is progress tracked and verified during execution?

**Activities:**
- [Specific activity 1]
- [Specific activity 2]

## 7. MODIFY
What adjustments or corrections are made?

**Activities:**
- [Specific activity 1]
- [Specific activity 2]

## 8. CONCLUDE
How does the job end and what post-execution activities occur?

**Activities:**
- [Specific activity 1]
- [Specific activity 2]
```

### Step 3: Conduct Customer Interviews to Validate and Detail the Map

**Interview approach (60-90 minutes):**

**Opening:** "I want to understand how you [do this job]. Walk me through the last time you did this, from the very beginning to the very end."

**For each step, ask:**
- "Before you actually [execute], what planning or preparation do you do?" (Define)
- "What information or materials do you need to gather first?" (Locate)
- "How do you set things up before starting?" (Prepare)
- "What checks do you do to make sure you're ready?" (Confirm)
- "Then what do you actually do?" (Execute)
- "How do you know if it's going well while you're doing it?" (Monitor)
- "What adjustments do you make along the way?" (Modify)
- "How do you know when you're done? What happens after?" (Conclude)

**Probing questions at each step:**
- "What makes that step difficult?"
- "What goes wrong at this stage?"
- "What are you trying to accomplish here?"
- "How do you measure success at this step?"
- "What would make this easier/faster/more reliable?"

**Interview 10-20 job executors** to ensure you've captured all activities at each step.

### Step 4: Uncover Desired Outcomes at Each Step

For every activity in your job map, ask: "What is the job executor trying to minimize, maximize, or avoid?"

**Outcome statement structure:**
```
[Direction] + [Performance metric] + [Object of control] + [Contextual clarifier]
```

**Example: "Prepare a meal" job map**

**DEFINE Step Activity:** "Plan which meal to prepare"

**Desired outcomes at this activity:**
- "Minimize the time it takes to decide what meal to prepare"
- "Minimize the likelihood of selecting a meal that household members won't enjoy"
- "Minimize the likelihood of planning a meal with unavailable ingredients"

**LOCATE Step Activity:** "Gather ingredients from pantry and refrigerator"

**Desired outcomes at this activity:**
- "Minimize the time it takes to locate all necessary ingredients"
- "Minimize the likelihood of discovering missing ingredients after starting"
- "Minimize the number of trips required between storage areas"

**Execute step:** You get the idea—repeat for all 8 steps.

**Target: 50-150 outcomes total** across all job steps.

## Common Job Mapping Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Skipping "Boring" Steps
**Wrong:** Focusing only on Execute because Define, Locate, and Conclude seem mundane.
**Right:** Some of the highest-opportunity outcomes are in the "boring" steps.

### Mistake 2: Making Steps Solution-Specific
**Wrong:** "Log into the software" (that's one solution's approach)
**Right:** "Access necessary data sources" (solution-agnostic activity)

### Mistake 3: Conflating Multiple Jobs
**Wrong:** Mixing "prepare a meal" and "clean up after a meal" into one map.
**Right:** These are separate jobs. Map them separately.

### Mistake 4: Making Steps Too Granular
**Wrong:** Breaking Execute into 30 micro-steps.
**Right:** Keep to 8 universal steps with sub-activities underneath.

### Mistake 5: Assuming All Customers Follow All Steps
**Wrong:** "Not everyone does Confirm, so I'll skip it."
**Right:** The Universal Job Map is a complete framework. Some customers skip steps because current solutions force them to, but desired outcomes exist at every step.

### Mistake 6: Describing What Your Product Does
**Wrong:** Mapping how customers use your product's features.
**Right:** Mapping the underlying job independent of any solution.

### Mistake 7: Stopping at the Job Map Without Uncovering Outcomes
**Wrong:** Creating the map and thinking you're done.
**Right:** The map is the framework for systematically uncovering 50-150 desired outcomes.

## Using the Job Map in Practice

### For Product Development
- **Prioritize features** that address underserved outcomes across multiple steps
- **Find white space** by examining steps competitors ignore
- **Reduce complexity** by removing features that address overserved outcomes

### For Customer Research
- **Structure interviews** using the 8 steps as a guide
- **Avoid missing outcomes** by systematically covering all steps
- **Compare across segments** to see if different users have different needs at each step

### For Competitive Analysis
- **Evaluate competitors** by how well they address outcomes at each step
- **Identify gaps** by finding steps where all competitors underserve
- **Differentiate** by excelling at steps competitors ignore

### For Marketing
- **Message to the job** rather than features
- **Highlight outcomes** customers care about at each step
- **Create content** that helps customers at different job steps (Define → educational content, Execute → case studies, etc.)

## Job Map Quality Checklist

Your job map is complete and accurate when:

- ✅ All 8 universal steps are present
- ✅ Each step contains 2-5 specific activities
- ✅ Activities are solution-agnostic (could be done without your product)
- ✅ Activities focus on what the customer does, not what the product does
- ✅ The map describes a single job (not multiple jobs conflated)
- ✅ 50-150 desired outcomes have been uncovered across all steps
- ✅ Outcomes are distributed across all 8 steps (not just Execute)
- ✅ Map validated with 10-20 job executor interviews
- ✅ No solution-specific language anywhere in the map

## Advanced Job Mapping Considerations

### When Jobs Have Variations

Some jobs have optional branches or different approaches. How to handle:

**Example:** "Prepare a meal" can be done:
- From scratch with raw ingredients
- With partially prepared ingredients
- By reheating pre-made meals

**Approach:**
1. Map the core job that all variations share
2. Note where variations diverge
3. Uncover outcomes specific to each variation
4. Look for outcomes that apply across all variations (highest-leverage opportunities)

### When Jobs Are Nested

Sometimes a job contains sub-jobs:
- "Monitor marketing performance" contains "create a report"
- "Prepare a meal" contains "determine freshness of ingredients"

**Decision:** Is the sub-job significant enough to map separately?

**Map separately if:**
- The sub-job takes significant time/effort
- Different people might execute the sub-job
- The sub-job has 50+ outcomes of its own
- Solutions exist specifically for this sub-job

**Keep integrated if:**
- The sub-job is a quick activity within a larger process
- It's always executed by the same person doing the main job
- It has fewer than 20 outcomes

### When Jobs Have Related Jobs

**Related jobs** are other jobs customers execute before, during, or after the core job.

**Example:** When "preparing a meal," related jobs include:
- "Determine which meals to prepare for the week" (before)
- "Set the table" (during)
- "Clean up after the meal" (after)

**Approach:**
- Map the core job first
- Identify related jobs
- Determine which related jobs represent significant opportunities
- Map high-priority related jobs separately

**Why this matters:** Sometimes the biggest opportunity is in a related job, not the core job. (Example: Intuit found huge opportunities in related jobs around "pay taxes," not in the core job itself.)

## Integration with Other JTBD Skills

Job mapping is the foundation that enables:

**Directly enables:**
- **outcome-discovery** — Use job map to systematically uncover outcomes at each step
- **customer-research** — Structure interviews using the job map framework

**Feeds into:**
- **jtbd-personas** — Segments may value outcomes at different steps differently
- **outcome-segmentation** — Some segments underserved at Execute, others at Define or Monitor
- **jtbd-strategy** — Competitors often ignore certain steps (opportunity for differentiation)

---

## Quick Start: Create Your First Job Map

**45-minute exercise:**

1. **Define your job** (5 min): Write a job statement for what your customers are trying to do
2. **Draft the map** (15 min): For each of 8 steps, write 2-3 activities
3. **Self-test** (10 min): Walk through the map as if you were doing the job—does it flow logically?
4. **Extract outcomes** (15 min): For each activity, write 2-3 desired outcomes

**You'll have:**
- Complete job map framework
- 50-80 draft outcomes
- Foundation for customer research

**Then validate** with 5-10 customer interviews before committing to quantitative research.

---

## Questions to Ask

Before starting job mapping:

1. What is the core functional job you want to map?
2. Who are the job executors (the people actually doing this job)?
3. Do you have access to interview job executors?
4. Are there multiple distinct jobs being conflated (that should be mapped separately)?
5. Is this job stable over time (was it relevant 10 years ago, will it be in 10 years)?
6. What's the goal (product development, research planning, competitive analysis)?
