# Jobs to be Done Research

Understand why customers buy by studying their struggle to make progress—not demographics, features, or stated preferences.

## Core Principle

> "People don't want products. They want progress."

Customers don't buy products for what they are or what they do. They "hire" products to help them make progress—to get from a struggling state to a better version of their life.

## What Is a Job to be Done?

A **Job** is your struggle to make a change for the better.
**To be** denotes anticipation for that change.
**Done** is when you overcome the struggle—you can do things you couldn't before.

### JTBD Is NOT:
- A task or activity (those are solutions)
- What the product does (that's functionality)  
- Customer demographics (those are correlations, not causes)
- Stated needs or wants (those change with solutions)

### Test: Is This a Job or a Solution?
Ask yourself:
1. Does this describe an action? → It's a solution
2. Can I visualize someone doing this? → It's a solution
3. Does this describe "how" instead of "why"? → It's a solution

**Example**: "Maintain the grass" is a solution. When Notre Dame switched to FieldTurf, the job remained but the solution changed. The job was about having a safe, attractive playing surface—not about grass maintenance.

## The Forces of Progress

Four emotional forces determine whether customers will change solutions:

```
DEMAND GENERATION (Top forces)
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ PUSH of the Situation                   │ → What's wrong with current state?
│ (External or internal dissatisfaction)  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ PULL of the New Solution                │ → What does better look like?
│ (Vision of progress + attraction to new)│
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

DEMAND REDUCTION (Bottom forces)
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ANXIETY of the New Solution             │ → Fear of switching/using
│ (Uncertainty, risk, "will it work?")    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ HABIT of the Present                    │ → Comfort with current state
│ (Inertia, switching costs, familiarity) │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**The Equation**: `(Push + Pull) > (Anxiety + Habit)` = Customer switches

### Identifying Each Force

**Push (External)**
- Life circumstances changed (new baby, moved cities)
- Current solution broke or became unavailable
- Price increased, quality declined

**Push (Internal)**
- Frustration, dissatisfaction with status quo
- Desire to become better version of self
- Fear of future consequences

**Pull (Better Life)**
- Vision of how things could be
- Specific outcomes they want to achieve
- Emotional state they want to reach

**Pull (Solution Attraction)**
- Features/qualities that draw them to specific option
- How this solution matches their hiring criteria
- Recommendation from trusted source

**Anxiety-in-Choice** (before buying)
- "Will it work for my situation?"
- "Is it worth the money?"
- "What if I choose wrong?"

**Anxiety-in-Use** (after buying)
- "Am I using it right?"
- "Will I get results?"
- "What will others think?"

**Habit-in-Choice**
- Locked into current contracts/systems
- Data/history with current solution
- Relationships with current provider

**Habit-in-Use**
- Skills developed around current solution
- Routines built around current workflow
- Comfort with "the way we've always done it"

## Defining Competition

> Competition is defined in the mind of the customer, not by product categories.

### The Creative Destruction Principle
When customers start using a new solution, they stop using something else. Competition is a zero-sum game at the individual level.

### Mapping Real Competition
Ask customers:
1. What did you use before this product?
2. If this product disappeared, what would you use instead?
3. What else did you consider before choosing this?

**Example**: Clarity (expert advice platform) competed with:
- Attending conferences
- Using LinkedIn for introductions
- Hiring advisors (equity)
- Reading books
- Doing nothing (staying in the dark)

These share zero features but solve the same job: "Help me get out of an entrepreneurial slump with inspirational advice from someone I respect."

## Describing a Job to be Done

Use this format:
```
[Action verb] me [from/to struggle] so I can [progress/better state]
```

**Example formats**:
- "Free me from the stress of figuring out safe products so I can enjoy being a parent"
- "Help me get out of an innovation slump with inspirational advice from someone I respect"
- "Give me a way to provide quality food for my family without the stress of running around"

### Testing Your JTBD Description
✓ Does it describe the solutions it replaced?
✓ Does it work for solutions from 10+ years ago?
✓ Does it focus on motivation, not functionality?
✓ Could multiple different products serve this job?

## Hiring Criteria

These connect the job to specific solution attributes:

```
Struggle → shapes → Hiring Criteria → filters → Solution Choice
```

**Hiring criteria** are qualities customers expect a solution to fulfill—NOT features.

**Example** (Clarity vs. Conference):
| Solution | Hiring Criteria Fulfilled |
|----------|--------------------------|
| Clarity | On-demand, personalized advice |
| Conference | Being around other entrepreneurs, seeing mentor live |

Different contexts create different hiring criteria, which is why multiple solutions coexist for the same job.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Studying happy customers** — They won't buy more. Study struggling customers.

2. **Trusting stated preferences** — Study revealed preferences (what they did), not stated preferences (what they say they want).

3. **Adding features for loyal users** — They're already buying. Focus on non-customers or churning customers.

4. **Confusing correlation with causation** — Demographics correlate with purchases; struggling moments cause them.

5. **Asking "What do you want?"** — Customers can't envision solutions. Ask "How did you solve this before?"

## Quick Analysis Framework

For any product/service, answer:
1. **The Job**: What progress is the customer trying to make?
2. **The Push**: What made the old way unacceptable?
3. **The Pull**: What does the better life look like?
4. **The Anxiety**: What's holding them back?
5. **The Habit**: What's keeping them in the current state?
6. **The Competition**: What else could they hire for this job?
7. **The Hiring Criteria**: What qualities must the solution have?
