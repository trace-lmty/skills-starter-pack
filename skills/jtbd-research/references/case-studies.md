# JTBD Case Studies

Real examples from practitioners applying Jobs to be Done thinking.

## Case Study 1: Clarity - Expert Advice Platform

**Company**: Marketplace connecting entrepreneurs with experts for advice calls

**The Research Process**:
- Interviewed customers about solutions they'd tried before Clarity
- Asked: "What other solutions did you consider? What would you use if Clarity didn't exist?"

**What They Learned**:

**Push**: Entrepreneurs in a slump, struggling with motivation, feeling stuck

**Pull**: Wanted inspiration from someone whose accomplishments they respect (not just advice—they could read books for that)

**Competition Discovered**:
- Attending conferences
- LinkedIn outreach
- Hiring advisors (equity)
- Reading books
- Online communities
- Doing nothing (biggest competitor)

**Key Insight**: Customers didn't just want advice—they wanted specific people. "There's real value in having Mark Cuban tell you 'Go get ten sales tomorrow' vs. reading it in a book."

**Anxiety Found**:
- "What if the expert doesn't answer my question?"
- "Is the call recorded?"
- "How do I prepare for a good call?"

**Actions Taken**:
1. Added "on-demand" to positioning (differentiated from conferences)
2. Recruited experts from SlideShare (people with inspiring presentations)
3. Created prep guides for both experts and customers
4. Priced against conference budgets, not software subscriptions

**Result**: Successful growth, eventually acquired by Fundable

## Case Study 2: YourGrocer - Meal Delivery

**Company**: Grocery delivery from local quality shops in Melbourne, Australia

**The Research Process**:
- Third co-founder insisted on JTBD research before joining
- Interviewed ~20 customers together as a team

**What They Learned**:

**Initial Assumption**: Young professionals who want to buy groceries online

**Actual Customer**: Young families with 2+ children

**The Triggering Event**:
```
First child → Shopping difficult but manageable
Second child → Shopping at multiple stores becomes impossible
                → Switch to supermarkets (convenience wins)
                → Quality suffers
                → YourGrocer restores quality + convenience
```

**Push**: Second child made shopping at quality stores impossible

**Pull**: Quality food for family without sacrificing family time

**Anxiety Found**:
- "How does delivery timing work?"
- Customers expected to choose delivery window FIRST, then groceries
- YourGrocer had it backwards → caused drop-offs

**Habit Challenge**:
- Customers used to "ducking to the store" when they ran out of something
- This habit pulled them back to supermarkets
- YourGrocer needed to help them become better meal planners

**Actions Taken**:
1. Changed checkout flow (delivery window first)
2. Created reminder emails ("Need a top-up? Free delivery")
3. Added "repeat last order" button
4. Featured local shop logos prominently (that's what signaled quality, not the word "quality")

**Key Quote from Research**: "YourGrocer does the running around for me"

## Case Study 3: Home Builder - Downsizer Condos

**Company**: Regional home builder near Detroit selling condos to empty nesters

**The Research Process**:
- Took pizza and flip chart to customers' homes
- Drew timeline: "This is today, here's when you first thought about moving. Tell us the story."

**What They Learned**:

- House too big
- Kids moved out

- Laundry in basement
- High taxes

**Pull Factors**:
- New, modern kitchen

   - Solution: Raised price, included moving service
   - Result: 22% increase in sales

2. **Emotional**: "What happens to the dining room table?"
   - The table was the "emotional bank account" of their lives
   - They kept saying they wanted a small dining room + big guest bedroom
   - But they couldn't move until they knew where the table would go
   - Solution: OPPOSITE of what they asked—small guest room, room for the table
   - Result: 27% increase in sales

**Timeline Discovery**:
- First thought typically during holiday preparation
- Event that triggered active looking: often attending a funeral
- "If we don't move now, one of us will have to do it alone"
- Moved ads from real estate section to obituaries
- Result: 37% increase in traffic, 70% reduction in ad costs

**Key Insight**: "We weren't just builders. We were a moving company."

## Case Study 4: SNHU - Online University

**Company**: Southern New Hampshire University's online program

**The Research Process**:
- Interviewed existing online students
- Understood why they chose online vs. just what they wanted

**What They Learned**:

**Traditional Student** (18, residential):
- Just graduated high school
- Carefree existence
- Focused on experience

**Online Student** (30+, working):
- Full-time job
- Often supporting family
- Sacrificing nights and weekends
- Wanted career, not just job
- Motivated internally—knew they had to change their station in life

**Competition**: Doing nothing was the biggest competitor

**The Timeline Challenge**:
- Ad creates emotional response → Sign up Friday night
- Old process: Application takes months to process
- By the time university responds, the energy is gone
- People change their minds

**Anxieties Addressed**:

1. **Application barriers**: No time for SAT/ACT, don't know where transcripts are
   - Solution: Start with interview, university gathers documents

2. **Processing time**: Momentum lost during wait
   - Solution: 7-day response time

3. **Retention**: Life gets in the way, students drop out
   - Solution: Academic advisors became life coaches

**Marketing Shift**:
- FROM: "We have online classes you can take anytime"
- TO: Emotional story showing the journey—struggling moment to pride of accomplishment

**Results**: 500 students → 130,000+ students in 10 years. $100M → $1.2B revenue.

## Common Patterns Across Case Studies

### 1. Competition Is Unexpected
- Clarity vs. conferences
- Children's theater vs. LEGO video games
- Online university vs. doing nothing

### 2. Customers Don't Know What They Want
- Empty nesters asked for big second bedroom
- Actually needed room for dining table
- Asking "what do you want?" gives wrong answers

### 3. Anxiety Is the Hidden Competitor
- YourGrocer: Confusing checkout flow
- Home builder: Fear of packing 3,000 sq ft
- SNHU: Application process barriers

### 4. Timing Matters
- SNHU: Lost customers during slow processing
- Home builder: Funeral triggers active looking
- Clarity: On-demand beat waiting for conferences

### 5. The Job Is Emotional
- Not "buy groceries" → "provide for my family without stress"
- Not "get a degree" → "secure a better future for my family"
- Not "get advice" → "feel confident I'm on the right path"
