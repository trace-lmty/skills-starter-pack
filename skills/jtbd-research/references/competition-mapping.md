# Competition Mapping

> "Competition is defined in the minds of customers, and they use progress as their criteria."

## The Fundamental Insight

Customers don't compare products by category, features, or price—they compare by **progress delivered**.

This means your real competitors are often products that share zero features with yours.

## Creative Destruction Principle

When customers start using a new solution, they stop using something else.

**Questions that reveal true competition**:
1. "What were you using before you found us?"
2. "If our product disappeared tomorrow, what would you use instead?"
3. "What else did you seriously consider?"
4. "What solutions have you tried in the past for this problem?"
5. "What would you spend this money on if not on us?"

## Competition Mapping Process

### Step 1: Identify the Job

First, understand what job your product is hired for. Multiple jobs = multiple competition sets.

**Example**: YouTube might be hired for:
- Entertainment → competes with Netflix, TikTok, gaming
- Learning → competes with courses, books, tutors
- Background noise → competes with music, podcasts, TV

### Step 2: Talk to Recent Switchers

Interview customers who:
- Recently started using your product (what did they fire?)
- Recently stopped using your product (what did they hire instead?)
- Are considering your product (what else is on their list?)

### Step 3: Map the Consideration Set

Create a list of everything customers consider when solving this job:

```
JOB: "Help me get unstuck with motivation from someone I respect"

CONSIDERATION SET:
├─ Clarity (expert calls)
├─ Attending conferences
├─ LinkedIn outreach
├─ Hiring an advisor (equity)
├─ Reading books by respected founders
├─ Joining entrepreneur communities
├─ Online courses
├─ Podcasts/interviews
└─ Doing nothing (staying stuck)
```

### Step 4: Analyze What Replaced What

```
Customer Journey:
┌────────────────┐    ┌────────────────┐    ┌────────────────┐
│  FIRED         │ →  │  FIRED         │ →  │  HIRED         │
│  Reading books │    │  Conferences   │    │  Clarity       │
│  (not personal │    │  (too expensive│    │  (on-demand,   │
│   enough)      │    │   and slow)    │    │   personal)    │
└────────────────┘    └────────────────┘    └────────────────┘
```

### Step 5: Understand Why Each Solution Won/Lost

For each competitor, identify:
- What hiring criteria does it fulfill?
- What hiring criteria does it fail?
- In what context does it win?
- In what context does it lose?

## Real Competition Examples

### Example 1: Children's Theater (Form Theatricals)

**Job**: "Help me teach my children life lessons in an engaging way"

**Unexpected Competitors**:
- LEGO Movie
- LEGO video games
- Girl Scouts
- Family game nights
- Disney movies

These share zero features with theater but solve the same job: creating shared experiences that teach children values.

### Example 2: YourGrocer (Meal Delivery)

**Job**: "Give me quality food without sacrificing family time"

**Competition Evolution**:
```
Stage 1 (Pre-kids): Multiple specialty shops
         ↓
Stage 2 (One kid): Mix of specialty + supermarket
         ↓
Stage 3 (Two+ kids): Supermarket only (convenience wins)
         ↓
Stage 4 (YourGrocer): Reclaim quality without losing convenience
```

**Real competitors**:
- Supermarkets (convenience)
- Subscription boxes (convenience but no choice)
- Meal kit services (convenience but have to cook)
- Hiring a housekeeper (ultimate convenience, high cost)

### Example 3: Online University (SNHU)

**Job**: "Help me secure a better future for my family"

**Competition**:
- Doing nothing (biggest competitor)
- Night classes at local college
- In-person degree programs
- Career change without degree
- Trade certifications
- YouTube/self-education

**Key insight**: The real competition was "doing nothing" because the anxiety and habit forces were so strong. SNHU won by:
1. Addressing functional barriers (transcripts, applications)
2. Emotional advertising (showing the journey)
3. Life coach support (ongoing habit formation)

## Budget Competition

A powerful question: "What budget does our product come out of?"

**Example - Clarity**:
- NOT coming from: Entertainment budget, monthly subscriptions
- IS coming from: Conference budget (travel, hotels, tickets, meals)

This means Clarity's pricing shouldn't be compared to other software—it should be compared to $3,000 conference trips.

## Competitive Response Strategies

### 1. When Competing Against Direct Competitors
Focus on hiring criteria differentiation:
- What criteria do you fulfill that they don't?
- In what contexts do you win?

### 2. When Competing Against Indirect Competitors
Focus on job story matching:
- Help customers see that you understand their real struggle
- Show how your solution is purpose-built for the job

### 3. When Competing Against Non-Consumption
Focus on reducing anxiety and habit:
- Lower barriers to trying
- Address specific fears
- Create urgency or time walls
- Help customers visualize progress

## Warning Signs You've Mapped Competition Wrong

1. **Customers use language you don't expect** — They describe competition you hadn't considered

2. **Customers aren't responding to competitive positioning** — Your differentiation doesn't matter to them

3. **You're losing to unexpected players** — Revenue declining without visible competitive threat

4. **Customers ask for features you consider off-strategy** — They're solving a different job than you think
