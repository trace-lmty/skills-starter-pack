# Forces of Progress - Deep Dive

The forces of progress are emotional forces that generate and shape customer demand. Two forces promote change; two forces block it.

## Detailed Analysis of Each Force

### PUSH: The Engine of Motivation

Push creates the energy for change. Without push, customers won't act—even with an amazing solution.

**External Pushes** (circumstances force change):
- Family situation changed (new baby, kids moved out, divorce)
- Work situation changed (new job, promotion, layoff)
- Current solution broke, became unavailable, or degraded
- Regulations or laws changed
- Price increased beyond tolerance
- Provider relationship deteriorated

**Internal Pushes** (emotional dissatisfaction):
- "I'm not the person I want to be"
- "I know there must be a better way"
- "I can't keep doing this"
- Fear of future consequences if nothing changes
- Embarrassment or frustration with current state
- Desire for growth or improvement

**Example - YourGrocer (meal delivery)**:
- External push: Second child born → grocery shopping became nightmare
- Internal push: "I shouldn't have to choose between quality food and family time"

**Finding Pushes in Interviews**:
- "What was going on when you first thought about switching?"
- "What made you realize the old way wasn't working?"
- "What would have happened if you hadn't changed?"

### PULL: The Steering Wheel

Pull directs the energy from push toward specific solutions. Two types:

**1. Pull Toward Better Life** (vision of progress):
- Picture of how life will be different
- Specific outcomes they're seeking
- Emotional state they want to achieve
- "I want to be the kind of person who..."

**2. Pull Toward Specific Solution** (attraction):
- Features that match their hiring criteria
- Brand/reputation/recommendation
- Specific capability they've heard about
- Visual or experiential attraction

**Example - Clarity (expert advice)**:
- Pull toward better life: "I want to feel confident about my decisions"
- Pull toward solution: "I can talk directly to Mark Cuban on my schedule"

**Finding Pulls in Interviews**:
- "When you imagined having this solved, what did that look like?"
- "What about this solution stood out to you?"
- "What would success look like?"

### ANXIETY: The Hidden Competitor

Anxiety blocks demand even when push and pull are strong. Often underestimated.

**Anxiety-in-Choice** (before purchasing):
- Will this actually work for my situation?
- Am I choosing the right option?
- Is it worth the money/time/effort?
- What if I look foolish for trying this?
- Can I get my money back if it doesn't work?
- Do I understand it well enough to decide?

**Anxiety-in-Use** (after purchasing):
- Am I using this correctly?
- Will I get the results others got?
- What if I can't figure it out?
- Will others judge my choice?
- Did I make a mistake?

**Example - Clarity**:
- Anxiety-in-choice: "What if the expert can't help me?"
- Anxiety-in-use: "I don't know how to prepare for the call"

**Attacking Anxiety**:
- Trials, demos, money-back guarantees
- Case studies showing people "like me"
- Reducing unknowns in the buying process
- Onboarding, training, support
- Setting realistic expectations

### HABIT: The Invisible Force

Habit is the most underestimated force. Customers often stay with inferior solutions purely due to habit.

**Habit-in-Choice** (barriers to switching):
- Data/history locked in current system
- Contracts or commitments
- Relationships with current provider
- Switching costs (time, money, effort)
- "Better the devil you know"

**Habit-in-Use** (patterns to break):
- Skills developed around current solution
- Routines and workflows built around it
- Mental models of "how things work"
- Comfort with the familiar
- Team/family using the same solution

**Example - YourGrocer**:
- Habit-in-choice: Years of shopping at specific stores
- Habit-in-use: Not planning meals → run to store when needed → fall out of YourGrocer habit

**Attacking Habit**:
- Import data from competitors (Excel reading Lotus files)
- Match familiar workflows where possible
- Create new habits (reminders, triggers, streaks)
- Focus on "moment of switching" support
- Help customers develop skills with your solution

## The Force Equation

```
SWITCH HAPPENS WHEN:
(Magnitude of Push + Magnitude of Pull) > (Magnitude of Anxiety + Magnitude of Habit)
```

**Key Insights**:

1. **You can't create push** — Push comes from the customer's life. You can only find people who already have it or wait for circumstances to create it.

2. **You CAN increase pull** — Through better product, messaging, demonstrations, etc.

3. **You CAN reduce anxiety** — Through guarantees, trials, education, support.

4. **You CAN reduce habit** — Through import tools, migration support, familiar patterns.

5. **Anxiety and habit are silent competitors** — You lose just as many customers to these forces as to actual competitors.

## Case Study: Home Builder (Moesta)

**Product**: New condos for downsizers (empty nesters)

**Push**:
- House too big
- Kids moved out  
- Yard too much work
- High taxes
- Laundry in basement

**Pull**:
- New, modern kitchen
- First-floor laundry
- Less maintenance
- Ability to travel
- Security when away

**Anxiety** (the real blockers):
- "How do we move 3,000 sq ft into 1,600 sq ft?"
- "How do we sell our current house?"
- "Where's the grocery store?"
- "What happens to all our stuff in the basement?"
- **The dining room table** (emotional bank of their life)

**Habit**:
- Friends and community in current location
- Memories in current house
- Familiar routines

**Solutions Applied**:
1. Raised price, included moving service (reduced functional anxiety)
2. Built sorting room at storage facility (reduced anxiety about belongings)
3. Made room for dining room table (addressed emotional anxiety)
4. Result: 27% increase in sales

**Key Learning**: The anxiety about the dining room table wasn't about dining—it was about memories. Features customers asked for (bigger second bedroom) were wrong. Understanding the forces revealed the real solution.
