# Opportunity Solution Tree (OST)

Build a visual framework that connects your desired business outcome to customer opportunities to solutions to assumption tests.

## When to Use

- Starting discovery for a new outcome
- Shifting from output-based to outcome-based work
- Team lacks shared understanding of priorities
- Decision-making feels stuck or contentious
- Stakeholders ask "why aren't you building X?"
- Structuring continuous discovery week-over-week
- Resolving tension between business and customer needs

## What It Solves

**The core problem:** Ill-structured problems (reaching outcomes) have infinite solutions and no "right" answer. How you frame the problem impacts how you solve it.

**OST provides:**
- Visual structure for exploring paths to outcome
- Customer-centric problem framing
- Shared team understanding
- Framework for decision-making
- Breakdown of big into small, solvable opportunities

## The Framework

### Four Levels (Top to Bottom)

1. **Outcome (Root)**
   - Your desired business outcome
   - How your team creates business value
   - Examples: "Increase weekly active users by 20%", "Reduce churn to <5%"

2. **Opportunity Space**
   - Customer needs, pain points, and desires
   - Filtered: Only include if addressing it could drive your outcome
   - Organized in tree structure (parents and children)

3. **Solution Space**
   - Solutions you're exploring to address opportunities
   - Multiple solutions per opportunity (compare and contrast)
   - NOT features you're building yet

4. **Assumption Tests**
   - How you'll evaluate which solutions work best
   - Tests for desirability, viability, feasibility, usability, ethics

## The Process

### Step 1: Define Your Outcome

**Start with a clear business outcome at the root.**

Good outcomes:
- Measurable and specific
- Business value clearly stated
- Time-bound (implicit or explicit)
- Examples:
  - "Increase weekly viewer minutes by 30%"
  - "Reduce customer acquisition cost to $50"
  - "Achieve 90% customer satisfaction score"

Place this at the top of your tree.

### Step 2: Map Top-Level Opportunities

**Identify distinct moments in your customer's experience.**

Use your experience map (if you have one):
- Each major node = potential top-level opportunity

Or identify from interview stories:
- What key moments appear across multiple stories?
- Where do customers encounter needs/pain points/desires?

**Ensure no overlap between top-level opportunities.**

Example (streaming entertainment):
- Deciding to watch something
- Choosing something to watch
- Watching something
- End of watching experience

These are distinct moments in time. Addressing one doesn't automatically address another.

### Step 3: Populate Opportunities from Interviews

**Review interview snapshots and extract opportunities.**

For each opportunity, ask:
1. Is it framed as customer need/pain point/desire (NOT a solution)?
2. Have we seen it in more than one interview (not unique to one customer)?
3. If we address this, will it drive our desired outcome?

If YES to all three, add to tree under appropriate top-level opportunity.

**Reframe if needed:**
- Too broad → Make more specific
- Could live under multiple branches → Split into multiple opportunities
- Solution in disguise → Uncover the implied need

### Step 4: Add Structure Within Each Branch

**Work one branch at a time.**

**Group similar opportunities:**
- Are they siblings? (Same parent, different specific needs)
- Or the same opportunity worded differently? (Combine them)

**Identify parent opportunities:**
- What's the broader need these siblings address?
- If parent wasn't explicitly mentioned in interviews, it's okay to add (it's implied)

**Build mini-trees:**
- Siblings → Parents → Grandparents
- Until you have a path from top-level opportunity to specific sub-opportunities

**Check for distinctness:**
- Can you address one without addressing siblings? ✅
- Does addressing one partially address parent? ✅
- Do siblings overlap too much? ❌ (Reframe)

### Step 5: Add Solutions (When Ready)

**For your target opportunity, generate multiple solutions.**

- 3 solutions minimum (enables compare and contrast)
- How else might we solve this?
- Different approaches, not variations

Place solutions under the target opportunity.

### Step 6: Add Assumption Tests

**For each solution, identify assumptions to test.**

Use assumption identification methods:
- Story mapping
- Pre-mortems
- Walk OST lines backward
- Explore potential harm

Place assumption tests under their respective solutions.

### Step 7: Maintain and Evolve

**OST is a living document. Update continuously as you learn.**

- New interviews → New opportunities
- Test results → Update understanding
- Opportunities evolve → Reframe, split, or combine
- Solutions fail → Revise opportunity understanding

**Weekly review:**
- Does tree still reflect what we know?
- Are opportunities still accurately framed?
- Do we need to reframe based on learnings?

## Key Principles

### Resolve Business vs Customer Tension

**Don't choose between business and customer needs. Align them.**

1. Start with business outcome (ensures team sustainability)
2. Filter opportunity space (only customer needs that drive outcome)
3. This creates customer-centric framing while maintaining business focus

### Break Project-Sized Work into Solvable Chunks

**Move vertically down the tree: opportunities get smaller.**

- Big opportunity (top-level)
  - Medium opportunities (children)
    - Small, solvable opportunities (grandchildren)

Solve small opportunities one at a time → Deliver value continuously → Eventually solve big opportunity

### Compare and Contrast (Not "Whether or Not")

**Avoid "Should we do this?" decisions.**

Instead ask:
- "Which of these opportunities is most important?"
- "Which of these solutions best addresses the opportunity?"
- "What else could we build?"

OST visualizes your options, making compare/contrast natural.

### Co-Evolve Problem and Solution Spaces

**Don't separate problem definition from solution exploration.**

- As you test solutions, learn more about opportunities
- When solutions fail, ask: "What did I misunderstand about the customer?"
- Update opportunity space based on solution learnings
- Let solution tests inform problem framing

## Deliverable

**A visual tree showing:**
- Outcome at top
- Opportunity space (structured by parent-child relationships)
- Solution space (for target opportunity you're exploring)
- Assumption tests (for solutions being evaluated)

**Maintained continuously** (not one-time artifact).

## Common Mistakes

1. **Jumping straight to solutions** - Skipping opportunity space mapping
2. **Single path thinking** - Not exploring multiple opportunities/solutions
3. **Static tree** - Creating once and never updating
4. **PM ownership** - OST should be owned by entire trio
5. **Too big opportunities** - Not breaking down to solvable chunks
6. **Forgetting to test** - Missing assumption testing layer
7. **Opportunities from company perspective** - Should be customer voice
8. **Vertical opportunities** - Parent with one child with one child (missing siblings)
9. **Multiple parents** - Same opportunity under different branches (too broad)
10. **Solutions disguised as opportunities** - "I wish I could fast-forward ads" (solution, not opportunity)

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Vertical opportunities:**
- Parent → one child → one child → one child
- Missing siblings
- Solution: Find related opportunities or reframe parent

**Multiple parents:**
- Same opportunity ladders to different top-level opportunities
- Too broad
- Solution: Make more specific, create separate opportunities for each context

**Company perspective:**
- "I wish I had more subscriptions" (no customer says this)
- Should be: "I want access to more compelling content"

**Solutions disguised as opportunities:**
- "I want to fast-forward through commercials" (only one solution)
- Should be: "I don't like commercials" (multiple solutions possible)

**Feelings as opportunities:**
- "I'm frustrated" (can't fix feelings)
- Should be: "I hate typing password every time" (can fix cause)

## Example Workflow

**Scenario:** Streaming entertainment. Outcome: Increase weekly viewer minutes.

**Step 1: Outcome**
```
[Increase weekly viewer minutes by 30%]
```

**Step 2: Top-level opportunities**
```
[Increase weekly viewer minutes by 30%]
├─ Deciding to watch something
├─ Choosing something to watch
├─ Watching something
└─ End of watching experience
```

**Step 3-4: Populate and structure (one branch)**
```
[Choosing something to watch]
├─ I can't find anything to watch
│   ├─ I'm out of episodes of my favorite shows
│   ├─ I can't figure out how to search for a specific show
│   └─ The show I was watching is no longer available
├─ Is this show any good?
│   ├─ What type of show is this?
│   ├─ Who is in this show?
│   └─ Is this similar to shows I've watched?
└─ I want to watch on the go
    ├─ I want to watch on my flight
    └─ I want to watch on my train commute
```

**Step 5: Add solutions (for target opportunity "I want to watch on my flight")**
```
[I want to watch on my flight]
├─ Solution 1: Enable offline downloads
├─ Solution 2: Pre-cache based on viewing history
└─ Solution 3: Partner with airlines for in-flight streaming
```

**Step 6: Add tests (for Solution 1)**
```
[Solution 1: Enable offline downloads]
├─ Test: Desirability - Do customers want to download?
├─ Test: Usability - Can they figure out how to download?
├─ Test: Feasibility - Can we implement DRM for downloads?
└─ Test: Viability - Will download capability reduce churn enough to justify cost?
```

## Tips for Success

### Getting Started
- Start small - map what you know now
- Don't aim for perfection - you'll iterate
- Focus on one outcome at a time
- Use physical or digital whiteboard

### Maintaining the Tree
- Update weekly (minimum)
- After each interview batch
- After each round of assumption tests
- When stakeholders ask questions

### Working as a Trio
- Build together, not solo
- Diverse perspectives matter
- Designer sees usability opportunities
- Engineer sees feasibility opportunities
- PM sees viability opportunities

### Stakeholder Communication
- Show the tree in update meetings
- Explains "why not building X"
- Shows thoughtfulness and customer-centricity
- Makes trade-offs visible

## Quality Indicators

**Good OST:**
- Multiple branches at each level
- Opportunities decrease in size as you go down
- Clear parent-child relationships
- No overlap between siblings
- Customer voice evident
- Updated regularly
- Team can easily reference it

**Poor OST:**
- Single path from outcome to solution
- All opportunities same size
- Company perspective, not customer
- Created once, never updated
- Locked in PM's head, not shared

## Tools

- Physical whiteboard + sticky notes
- Miro, Mural, FigJam
- Any tool that lets you visualize tree structure
- Key: Make it visible and editable
