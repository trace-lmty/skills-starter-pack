# Outcome Discovery

You are an expert in uncovering and structuring desired outcome statements using Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) methodology. Your goal is to help users discover the 50-150 measurable outcomes customers use to judge success when executing a job—the foundation of Outcome-Driven Innovation.

## The Core Insight

**Customers don't want products—they want to achieve outcomes.**

When customers "hire" a product to get a job done, they have specific metrics they use to measure success. These metrics are called **desired outcomes**, and they are:

- **Stable over time** — The outcome "minimize the time it takes to set the blade angle" was true 20 years ago and will be true 20 years from now
- **Solution-agnostic** — No mention of products, features, or technologies
- **Measurable** — Quantifiable performance metrics, not vague adjectives
- **Controllable by design** — A product can be designed to improve performance on this metric

**Why this matters:** When you know all the customer's desired outcomes and which ones are underserved (important but poorly satisfied), innovation becomes predictable. You know exactly what metrics to optimize.

---

## What is a Desired Outcome?

A desired outcome is **a customer-defined metric for measuring success when executing a job.**

**Examples:**

| Job-to-be-Done | Desired Outcome |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Cut a piece of wood in a straight line | Minimize the time it takes to set the blade angle |
| Monitor marketing campaign performance | Minimize the likelihood that important insights are overlooked |
| Prepare a meal | Minimize the time it takes to determine which ingredients are needed |
| Listen to music while exercising | Minimize the likelihood that the music sounds distorted at high volume |

**What outcomes are NOT:**
- ❌ Solutions: "Use AI to analyze campaigns"
- ❌ Features: "Have a dashboard with real-time data"
- ❌ Requirements: "Must update every 5 seconds"
- ❌ Benefits: "Save time and money"
- ❌ Vague wants: "Make it easier and faster"

Desired outcomes are the **metrics** customers use to judge solutions. Solutions change. Outcomes don't.

---

## The Desired Outcome Statement Structure

Every outcome statement must follow this precise structure:

```
[Direction of improvement] + [Performance metric] + [Object of control] + [Contextual clarifier]
```

### Component 1: Direction of Improvement

How the customer wants to change performance:

- **Minimize** (most common)
- **Maximize** (for positive metrics)
- **Avoid** (rare, only when truly trying to prevent something)

**Examples:**
- Minimize the time...
- Maximize the accuracy...
- Avoid the need to...

### Component 2: Performance Metric

The measurable unit customers use to judge success:

**Common metric types:**
- **Time:** "the time it takes to..."
- **Likelihood/Probability:** "the likelihood that..." or "the probability that..."
- **Number/Quantity:** "the number of..." or "the amount of..."
- **Effort/Energy:** "the effort required to..." or "the energy expended to..."
- **Variability:** "the variability in..." or "the variation in..."
- **Degree:** "the degree to which..."
- **Frequency:** "the frequency with which..."

**Rules:**
- Must be quantifiable (even if customers don't have exact numbers)
- Avoid vague terms: "easily," "quickly," "accurately" are NOT metrics
- Focus on one metric per statement

### Component 3: Object of Control

What is being measured or controlled? The "what" that the metric applies to.

**Examples:**
- "...identify underperforming campaigns" (process step)
- "...the cut goes off track" (undesired event)
- "...ingredients are missing" (resource state)
- "...data sources must be consulted" (inputs required)

**Rules:**
- Solution-agnostic (don't mention products)
- Stable over time
- Clear and specific

### Component 4: Contextual Clarifier

Describes the job step, condition, or circumstance where this outcome matters.

**Examples:**
- "...when guiding the blade along the cut line"
- "...before starting execution"
- "...across multiple channels"
- "...when operating in variable conditions"

**Rules:**
- Provides necessary context without being redundant
- Maps to a specific job step when possible
- Can be omitted if outcome is clear without it

## The Complete Formula in Action

### Example 1: Circular Saw (Bosch Case Study)

**Poorly written need:** "I need a better blade adjustment system"

**Desired outcome statement:**
```
Minimize [direction] the time it takes [metric] to set the blade angle [object] before making a cut [context]
```

### Example 2: Marketing Analytics

**Poorly written need:** "I want real-time dashboards"

**Desired outcome statement:**
```
Minimize [direction] the likelihood [metric] that important insights are overlooked [object] when analyzing campaign performance [context]
```

### Example 3: Meal Preparation

**Poorly written need:** "Help me find ingredients faster"

**Desired outcome statement:**
```
Minimize [direction] the time it takes [metric] to locate all necessary ingredients [object] when preparing to cook [context]
```

---

## The Rules for Writing Outcome Statements

### Rule 1: One Outcome Per Statement (No Compound Statements)

**Wrong:** "Minimize the time and effort required to identify and fix errors"

**Right (split into separate outcomes):**
- "Minimize the time it takes to identify errors"
- "Minimize the effort required to correct errors"

### Rule 2: No Adjectives or Adverbs

**Wrong:** "Easily minimize the time to quickly identify campaigns"

**Right:** "Minimize the time it takes to identify underperforming campaigns"

Adjectives like "easily" or "quickly" are vague. The metric "time" is already measurable.

### Rule 3: No Solutions or Product References

**Wrong:** "Minimize the time it takes to use the AI dashboard to analyze data"

**Right:** "Minimize the time it takes to identify anomalies in performance data"

### Rule 4: No Specifications or Targets

**Wrong:** "Minimize the time it takes to generate reports to under 5 seconds"

**Right:** "Minimize the time it takes to generate executive-ready reports"

Specifications ("under 5 seconds") are constraints, not outcomes. Customers want to minimize time—how fast is a design decision.

### Rule 5: Must Be Measurable

**Wrong:** "Improve the experience of finding information"

**Right:** "Minimize the time it takes to locate relevant information"

"Experience" is not measurable. "Time" is.

### Rule 6: Solution-Agnostic and Stable

**Wrong:** "Minimize the time it takes to connect to WiFi"

**Right:** "Minimize the time it takes to access necessary data sources"

WiFi is a solution (and might not exist in 10 years). The underlying outcome is accessing data—that's stable.

### Rule 7: Controllable by Design

**Wrong:** "Maximize the weather being sunny during the job"

**Right:** "Minimize the likelihood that weather conditions disrupt the job"

You can't control weather, but you can design solutions that minimize weather-related disruption.

## How to Uncover Desired Outcomes: The Process

### Step 1: Define the Job-to-be-Done

Before you can uncover outcomes, you must be clear on which job you're studying.

**Job statement structure:**
```
[Verb] + [Object of the verb] + [Contextual clarifier]
```

**Examples:**
- "Monitor marketing campaign performance across channels"
- "Cut a piece of wood in a straight line"
- "Prepare a nutritious meal with available ingredients"

**See the job-mapping skill** for detailed guidance on defining jobs.

### Step 2: Map the Job Using the Universal Job Map

Every job consists of 8 universal steps:

```
DEFINE → LOCATE → PREPARE → CONFIRM → EXECUTE → MONITOR → MODIFY → CONCLUDE
```

**Why this matters:** 50-80% of desired outcomes occur in steps OTHER than Execute. If you only focus on execution, you'll miss most customer needs.

**See the job-mapping skill** for the complete Universal Job Map framework.

### Step 3: Conduct Qualitative Customer Interviews

Interview 10-20 **job executors** (the people actually doing the job, not buyers or managers).

**Interview structure (60-90 minutes):**

**Part 1: Validate the job (5-10 min)**
- "Tell me about the last time you [did this job]."
- "Walk me through what you were trying to accomplish."

**Part 2: Map the job process (15-25 min)**

Walk through each Universal Job Map step:

1. **Define:** "How do you plan what needs to be done?"
2. **Locate:** "What inputs or information do you need to gather?"
3. **Prepare:** "What setup is required before you can start?"
4. **Confirm:** "How do you verify you're ready to proceed?"
5. **Execute:** "What's the core activity you perform?"
6. **Monitor:** "How do you track whether things are going well?"
7. **Modify:** "What adjustments do you make along the way?"
8. **Conclude:** "How do you know when you're done?"

**Part 3: Uncover desired outcomes at each step (30-50 min)**

For each job step, ask the core question:

**"What are you trying to minimize, maximize, or avoid at this step?"**

**Follow-up probes:**
- "What would make this step faster?"
- "What would make this more reliable?"
- "What goes wrong here?"
- "How do you measure success at this step?"
- "What's frustrating about this step?"
- "What would the ideal outcome be?"

**Listen for outcome clues:**
- **Metric words:** time, cost, likelihood, effort, accuracy, consistency, frequency
- **Pain expressions:** "It's so hard to...", "I wish I could...", "The problem is..."
- **Workarounds:** "I have to check multiple times because..."
- **Trade-offs:** "I sacrifice speed for accuracy here..."

**Interview tips:**
- Record and transcribe (don't rely on notes alone)
- Stay in observer mode (don't pitch your product)
- Avoid leading questions
- Probe for specifics: "Can you give me an example?"
- Redirect solution talk to outcomes: "Why do you want that feature? What would it help you accomplish?"

### Step 4: Extract Outcome Statements from Interview Transcripts

After each interview, review the transcript and extract desired outcomes.

**Example extraction process:**

**Interview quote:**
> "I spend way too much time trying to figure out which campaigns are working. I have to log into Google Ads, Facebook, LinkedIn, and then our internal CRM, and even then the numbers don't always match up. By the time I've pulled it all together, I've lost an hour and I'm still not totally confident the data is right."

**Extracted outcomes:**
1. Minimize the time it takes to identify which campaigns are performing well
2. Minimize the number of data sources that must be consulted to assess campaign performance
3. Minimize the likelihood that performance data from different sources is inconsistent
4. Maximize confidence in the accuracy of campaign performance data

**Transformation process:**
1. Identify the pain or goal in the customer's words
2. Extract the underlying metric (time, likelihood, confidence, number, etc.)
3. Identify what's being measured (object of control)
4. Structure using the outcome formula
5. Ensure it's solution-agnostic and stable

### Step 5: Consolidate and Organize Outcomes

After 10-20 interviews, you'll have 150-300 raw outcome statements with significant overlap.

**Consolidation process:**

1. **Group similar outcomes** — Cluster statements measuring the same thing
2. **Choose the best wording** — Select the clearest, most measurable version
3. **Eliminate duplicates** — Ruthlessly remove redundancy
4. **Validate structure** — Ensure every outcome follows the proper format
5. **Organize by job step** — Map outcomes to the Universal Job Map

**Target: 50-150 unique outcomes**
- **< 50 outcomes:** You likely missed outcomes (interview more people or probe deeper)
- **> 150 outcomes:** Too much overlap or too granular (consolidate more aggressively)

**Quality check:**
- ✅ Direction + metric + object + context structure
- ✅ Measurable and specific
- ✅ Solution-agnostic
- ✅ Stable over time
- ✅ No adjectives or compound statements
- ✅ Distributed across all 8 job steps

### Step 6: Validate Outcomes with Customers

Before moving to quantitative research, validate your outcome set:

**Validation interview (30-45 min):**
- Present the complete set of outcomes to 3-5 job executors
- Ask: "Do these capture what you're trying to accomplish?"
- Listen for: "You're missing..." or "This one doesn't apply..."
- Refine based on feedback

**Red flags:**
- Customers confused by outcome wording (too abstract or technical)
- Customers say "That's not relevant to what I do" (too narrow or wrong job)
- Customers suggest many missing outcomes (incomplete set)

## Common Outcome Discovery Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Writing Solutions Instead of Outcomes

**Wrong:** "Minimize the time it takes to use the AI-powered dashboard to analyze data"

**Right:** "Minimize the time it takes to identify anomalies in campaign data"

The customer doesn't care about AI dashboards—they care about finding anomalies quickly.

### Mistake 2: Using Vague Language

**Wrong:** "Easily and quickly access information"

**Right:** "Minimize the time it takes to access relevant performance data"

"Easily" and "quickly" are not metrics. "Time" is.

### Mistake 3: Creating Compound Statements

**Wrong:** "Minimize the time and effort required to find and fix errors"

**Right (split into 4 outcomes):**
- "Minimize the time it takes to identify errors"
- "Minimize the effort required to identify errors"
- "Minimize the time it takes to correct errors"
- "Minimize the effort required to correct errors"

### Mistake 4: Including Specifications

**Wrong:** "Minimize the time it takes to load the dashboard to under 3 seconds"

**Right:** "Minimize the time it takes to access campaign performance data"

"Under 3 seconds" is a target or requirement, not an outcome.

### Mistake 5: Focusing Only on the Execute Step

**Wrong:** Capturing 40 outcomes all related to "Analyze campaign performance" (Execute step only)

**Right:** Distributing 50-150 outcomes across all 8 Universal Job Map steps

Most underserved outcomes are in Define, Locate, Prepare, Confirm, Monitor, Modify, and Conclude—not Execute.

### Mistake 6: Writing from Company Perspective

**Wrong:** "Maximize our ability to upsell premium features"

**Right:** "Minimize the time it takes to access advanced analytics capabilities"

Outcomes are customer-defined, not company goals.

### Mistake 7: Accepting Outcome Statements That Aren't Stable

**Wrong:** "Minimize the time it takes to connect to 5G networks"

**Right:** "Minimize the time it takes to access high-speed data connectivity"

5G is a current technology. The outcome is about connectivity speed—that's stable.

### Mistake 8: Missing Outcomes at Overlooked Steps

**Common gap:** Very few outcomes at Define, Locate, or Conclude steps

**Fix:** Explicitly probe these steps in interviews:
- "Before you even start [Execute], how do you plan? What goes wrong there?"
- "After you're done, what happens? What's difficult about that?"

### Mistake 9: Interviewing the Wrong People

**Wrong:** Interviewing buyers, managers, or people who delegate the job

**Right:** Interviewing job executors—the people actually trying to get the job done

### Mistake 10: Stopping at Qualitative Research

**Wrong:** Using 10 interviews to guess which outcomes are most important

**Right:** Conducting quantitative survey (n=180-3000) to measure importance and satisfaction

Qualitative uncovers outcomes. Quantitative reveals which are underserved.

---

## Outcome Discovery Quick Start

**90-minute workshop to create initial outcome set:**

1. **Define the job** (10 min)
   - Write job statement: [Verb] + [Object] + [Context]
   - Test: Is it solution-agnostic? Stable over time?

2. **Map the job** (20 min)
   - List 2-3 activities for each Universal Job Map step
   - DEFINE → LOCATE → PREPARE → CONFIRM → EXECUTE → MONITOR → MODIFY → CONCLUDE

3. **Brainstorm outcomes at each step** (40 min)
   - For each activity, ask: "What is the customer trying to minimize, maximize, or avoid?"
   - Write outcomes using the formula: Direction + Metric + Object + Context
   - Target: 5-10 outcomes per job step = 40-80 total

4. **Review and refine** (20 min)
   - Check that each outcome follows the structure
   - Eliminate duplicates
   - Ensure solution-agnostic and measurable

**You'll have:** A draft outcome set to validate with customer interviews.

**Then:** Conduct 5-10 interviews to refine and complete the set before quantitative validation.

## Integration with Other JTBD Skills

Outcome discovery is central to all JTBD work:

**Prerequisites (do these first):**
- **job-mapping** — Use the Universal Job Map to systematically uncover outcomes at each step

**Outcomes enable (do these next):**
- **customer-research** — Measure importance and satisfaction for each outcome quantitatively
- **outcome-segmentation** — Discover segments with unique patterns of underserved outcomes
- **jtbd-personas** — Build personas around which outcomes segments value most
- **jtbd-strategy** — Choose which outcomes to target with which growth strategy

**Without proper outcomes, everything downstream breaks:**
- Poor outcomes → poor quantitative research → poor segmentation → poor strategy → product failure

---

## Outcome Statement Quality Checklist

Your desired outcome statements are ready when:

- ✅ 50-150 unique outcome statements captured
- ✅ Every outcome follows: Direction + Metric + Object + Context
- ✅ No adjectives, adverbs, or vague language
- ✅ No solutions, products, or technologies mentioned
- ✅ Every outcome is measurable (even if not precisely quantified)
- ✅ Outcomes are stable (true 10 years ago, true 10 years from now)
- ✅ Outcomes distributed across all 8 Universal Job Map steps
- ✅ No compound statements (one metric per outcome)
- ✅ Validated with 3-5 job executors
- ✅ Ready for quantitative importance/satisfaction survey

---

## Questions to Ask

Before starting outcome discovery:

1. What is the core functional job you're studying?
2. Have you created a Universal Job Map for this job?
3. Who are the job executors (not buyers or managers)?
4. Do you have access to interview 10-20 job executors?
5. What outcomes have you already hypothesized?
6. Are you capturing outcomes for job executors, buyers, or lifecycle support team?
7. What will you do with outcomes once captured (quantitative research, product strategy)?
