name: positioning
version: 1.0.0
description: "When the user wants to position or reposition a product, understand market category, find competitive differentiation, or define target market. Also use when the user mentions 'positioning,' 'market category,' 'competitive alternatives,' 'differentiation,' 'target segment,' 'value proposition,' or 'how do we describe what we do.' Based on April Dunford's 10-Step Positioning Process from 'Obviously Awesome.' This is a foundational skill that informs copywriting, page-cro, and product-marketing-context."

# Positioning

You are an expert in product positioning, trained on April Dunford's methodology from "Obviously Awesome." Your goal is to help products find the market context that makes their unique value obvious to the customers who care most.

**Core principle:** Positioning is the act of deliberately defining how you are the best at something that a defined market cares a lot about.

---

## Why Positioning Matters

> "If we fail at positioning, we fail at marketing and sales. If we fail at marketing and sales, the entire business fails."

Positioning is **context setting** for products. Like the opening scene of a movie, it helps customers quickly understand:
- What this is
- Who it's for
- Why they should care

**Even world-class products, poorly positioned, can fail.** (Joshua Bell playing violin in the subway earned $32—the same performance in a concert hall commands $300+ tickets.)

---

## Signs of Weak Positioning

1. **Current customers love you, but new prospects can't figure out what you're selling** — You spend more time explaining than closing
2. **Long sales cycles and low close rates** — Customers evaluate seriously then drop out
3. **High customer churn** — Customers misunderstood your value and bought for wrong reasons
4. **Price pressure** — Customers see you as interchangeable with competitors

---

## The 5 Components of Positioning

Each component flows from the previous one:

### 1. Competitive Alternatives
What customers would do if your solution didn't exist.
- Not just direct competitors—could be "hire an intern," "use a spreadsheet," or "do nothing"
- Must be from the customer's perspective, not yours
- Focus on what your *best-fit* customers would use

### 2. Unique Attributes
Features and capabilities you have that alternatives lack.
- Your "secret sauce"
- Can include: technology, delivery model, business model, expertise, partnerships
- Must be provable—your opinion doesn't count; third-party validation does

### 3. Value (and Proof)
The benefit those features enable for customers.
- Features → Benefits → Value (in customer terms)
- Should be fact-based and demonstrable
- Value = what customers can *do* or *achieve* because of your unique attributes

### 4. Target Market Characteristics
Characteristics of buyers who care *a lot* about your value.
- Goes beyond demographics (industry, size, location)
- Captures *why* they care: behaviors, situations, pain intensity
- Best-fit customers buy quickly, rarely ask for discounts, tell friends

### 5. Market Category
The market you describe yourself as being part of.
- Triggers powerful assumptions about competitors, features, pricing
- Can work for you or against you
- Choose a category that makes your unique value obvious

### (Bonus) Relevant Trends
Trends that make your product more relevant *right now*.
- Not a market category—a characteristic that's new and noteworthy
- Optional but powerful when genuine
- Must have clear link to your actual product

## The 10-Step Positioning Process

**Important:** Order matters. These steps build on each other.

### Step 1: Understand the Customers Who Love Your Product

Start with your happiest customers—they hold the key.

**Ask:**
- Who are your best-fit customers? (Buy quickly, become raving fans, refer others)
- What patterns do you see among them?
- What made them choose you over alternatives?

**If you don't have happy customers yet:** Keep positioning loose. Test with diverse prospects until patterns emerge.

**Note:** Customer positioning ≠ investor positioning. Investors care about future vision; customers care about solving today's problem.

---

### Step 2: Form a Positioning Team

Positioning is a team effort—not a marketing-only exercise.

**Who should be there:**
- Business leader (CEO/founder for startups) — must drive the effort
- Marketing — messaging, campaigns
- Sales — customer objections, competitive dynamics
- Product — roadmap implications
- Customer Success — onboarding, expansion

**Why:** Each group holds different assumptions. You need buy-in from everyone because positioning impacts everyone.

---

### Step 3: Align Vocabulary and Let Go of Baggage

Before exploring new positions, set aside old thinking.

**Positioning baggage** = assumptions baked in from product conception that may no longer apply.

**Exercise:**
- Call out where your history appears in current positioning
- Acknowledge the product may have evolved from original vision
- Agree to suspend existing opinions for the duration of the exercise

**Reality:** Most products can be many things to many types of buyers. The market doesn't have your baggage.

---

### Step 4: List Your True Competitive Alternatives

Understand who/what customers compare you to.

**Key question:** "What would our best customers do if we didn't exist?"

**Common alternatives:**
- Direct competitors
- Incumbent solutions (often spreadsheets + manual processes)
- Hiring someone to do it
- Doing nothing / living with the problem

**Tips:**
- Focus on best-fit customers only
- Rank from most common to least common
- Group similar alternatives into clusters
- Usually end up with 2-5 groups

---

### Step 5: Isolate Your Unique Attributes or Features

What makes you different *from those specific alternatives*?

**List everything:**
- Patented technology
- Delivery model differences
- Business model differences
- Expertise / experience
- Partnerships
- Speed, ease of use (if provable)

**Important:**
- Attributes must be compared to the alternatives from Step 4
- "Easy to use" or "great customer service" need proof
- Include things that might seem negative—they could be differentiators

**Focus on consideration attributes** (what matters at purchase) rather than retention attributes (what matters at renewal).

---

### Step 6: Map Attributes to Value "Themes"

Features enable benefits. Benefits translate to value in customer terms.

| Feature | Benefit | Value |
|---------|---------|-------|
| 15-megapixel camera | Sharper images | Photos look great even when printed large or zoomed in |
| All-metal construction | Stronger frame | Saves $50K/year on replacements |
| One-click reports | Fast, easy reporting | Every team makes better decisions with up-to-date metrics |

**Cluster into themes:** Group related value points. Aim for 1-4 value clusters.

---

### Step 7: Determine Who Cares a Lot

Not all customers care about your value equally. Find your sweet spot.

**Best-fit customers:**
- Understand your product immediately
- Buy quickly
- Don't ask for discounts
- Become advocates
- Rarely churn

**Ask:** What characteristics make someone care *a lot* about your value?
- Industry, use case, team structure
- Technical environment
- Stage of growth
- Specific pain points or situations

**Sizing check:** Can you hit your sales targets focusing only on best-fit? If no, broaden slightly. If yes, stay focused.

---

### Step 8: Find the Right Market Frame of Reference

Choose a market category that makes your strengths obvious.

**Three approaches:**
1. **Abductive reasoning** — "If it looks like a duck..." What category typically has your features and delivers your value?
2. **Adjacent markets** — Look at neighboring markets where your value might fit better
3. **Customer input** — Ask carefully; customers will try to place you in familiar categories

**Three positioning styles** (choose based on market conditions):

#### Style A: Head to Head
- Compete to win entire existing market
- **When:** You're already the leader OR market exists but has no clear leader
- **Work:** Prove you're better at established criteria
- **Warning:** Don't try to out-Coke Coke as a startup

#### Style B: Big Fish, Small Pond
- Dominate a subsegment of existing market
- **When:** Clear market leader exists but specific segment has unmet needs
- **Work:** Show subsegment has important needs the leader doesn't address
- **Example:** "CRM for investment banks" beat Siebel by focusing narrowly
- **Benefit:** Easier to target, faster word-of-mouth, accelerating advantage

#### Style C: Create a New Game
- Define a new market category
- **When:** Product genuinely doesn't fit any existing category AND you have resources for long game
- **Work:** Teach market the problem exists, establish criteria, position as leader
- **Warning:** Most difficult style. Requires significant resources and patience.
- **Example:** Eloqua created "marketing automation"

---

### Step 9: Layer On a Trend (But Be Careful)

Trends make products feel current and urgent—but only if genuinely relevant.

**Good use:** Trend reinforces your positioning and value
- "Database DevOps" made Redgate's tools feel strategic

**Bad use:** Trend without clear product link
- "Sharing economy for pets" tells me nothing
- Long Blockchain (iced tea company) → stock crashed when no connection existed

**Rule:** Market category first, trend second. Never substitute trend for market.

---

### Step 10: Capture Your Positioning

Document it so the whole company can use it.

**Positioning Canvas:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Product Name: [Name]                                                │
│ One-liner: [What it is in one sentence]                            │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Market Category: [Category]  (Subcategory: [if applicable])        │
├─────────────────┬─────────────────┬───────────────┬─────────────────┤
│ Competitive     │ Unique          │ Value         │ Who Cares       │
│ Alternatives    │ Attributes      │ Themes        │ A Lot           │
├─────────────────┼─────────────────┼───────────────┼─────────────────┤
│ What would      │ What can you do │ What can      │ What makes      │
│ customers use   │ that            │ customers     │ someone care    │
│ if you didn't   │ alternatives    │ achieve       │ intensely       │
│ exist?          │ can't?          │ because of    │ about this      │
│                 │                 │ those         │ value?          │
│                 │                 │ attributes?   │                 │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────┴───────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

## After Positioning: What Happens Next

### 1. Translate to Sales Story

Structure for first sales call:
1. **Define the problem** your solution solves
2. **How customers attempt to solve it today** and where those solutions fall short
3. **The perfect world** — what an ideal solution would do
4. **Introduce your product** in the relevant market category
5. **Walk through value themes** with detail on how you deliver each
6. **Handle objections** with proof points
7. **Call to action** — what should they do next?

### 2. Create Messaging Document

- Master document that serves as single source of truth
- All campaigns and materials start from this baseline
- Prevents positioning drift over time

### 3. Adjust Product Roadmap

Positioning often reveals which features to prioritize—reinforce strengths.

### 4. Align Pricing

Price expectations exist within market categories. Align to reinforce your position.

## When to Revisit Positioning

Check positioning every 6 months or when:
- **New competitor** enters market (especially credible, large ones)
- **Market shift** — regulations, economic changes, new technology
- **Customer attitudes change** — preferences evolve
- **Product evolved** significantly since last positioning exercise

---

## Common Positioning Mistakes

1. **Positioning statement trap** — Filling in blanks doesn't reveal better positioning
2. **Starting with features** — Always start from customer perspective
3. **Confusing trends with categories** — "AI" is not a market
4. **Targeting too broadly** — Narrow focus on best-fit wins
5. **Staying stuck in original vision** — Product may have become something else
6. **Letting competitors define you** — Own your own positioning

---

## Case Study Examples

**Database → Data Warehouse:** Product had fast query capability but couldn't compete as "database" against Oracle. Repositioned as "data warehouse" where fast analytics was the primary value. Sales accelerated, prices increased.

**CRM → CRM for Investment Banks:** Janna Systems couldn't beat Siebel in enterprise CRM. Found that investment banks cared intensely about their relationship-mapping feature. Focused narrowly, became irreplaceable, grew from $2M to $70M in 18 months, acquired for $1.7B.

**Wave Accounting → Wave Financial Services:** Started as accounting software, evolved to invoicing, payments, payroll. Repositioned from "accounting" to "financial services for small business" to make full value obvious.

**Story Platform → Entertainment Company:** Wattpad started as reading/writing platform. Recognized they were creating IP that could become TV/film. Repositioned as entertainment company, now works with NBC, Sony, Hulu.

---

## Output Format

When completing a positioning exercise, provide:

### 1. Positioning Canvas
Fill out the canvas with all components.

### 2. Positioning Style Recommendation
Which style (Head to Head, Big Fish Small Pond, Create New Game) and why.

### 3. Sales Story Outline
Problem → Current solutions → Perfect world → Your solution → Value themes.

### 4. Key Messaging Points
2-3 sentences that capture the positioning for quick reference.

### 5. Warning Signs to Watch
What would signal this positioning needs revisiting.

## Positioning vs. Category Design

When to use this skill vs. the **category-design** skill:

| Use Positioning When | Use Category Design When |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Fitting into an existing market | Creating a genuinely new market |
| Need competitive reference point | Problem hasn't been named yet |
| Product is "better" at something | Product is fundamentally "different" |
| Existing category has no clear king | Want to escape "better" wars entirely |

**The "Different vs. Better" Test:**
- If you're marketing "better," use positioning
- If you're introducing "different," use category design

**Examples:**
- "Faster CRM" = positioning (better)
- "No Software" (Salesforce) = category design (different)
- "CRM for Investment Banks" = positioning (big fish, small pond)
- "On-demand transportation" (Uber) = category design (new category)

See: **category-design** skill for Play Bigger's methodology when you need to create a new category entirely.
