# Positioning Frameworks and Examples

Detailed reference material from April Dunford's "Obviously Awesome."

## The Positioning as Context Concept

**Core insight:** Context enables people to figure out what's important. Products without clear context are difficult to understand.

### The Joshua Bell Experiment

Internationally acclaimed violinist Joshua Bell regularly sells out concert halls at $300+ per ticket. The Washington Post arranged for him to play in a DC subway station during morning commute.

**Results over 45 minutes:**
- 1,070 people passed by
- 27 gave money
- Only 7 paused to listen
- Total earnings: $32.17

**The lesson:** The music didn't change. The context did. In a concert hall, everything signals value—stage, orchestra, dress, program. In a subway, he looked like just another street performer.

> "Even a world-class product, poorly positioned, can fail."

## The Two Positioning Traps

### Trap 1: Stuck on Original Vision

Your product evolved, but your positioning didn't.

**Example:** You set out to make "the greatest chocolate cake" but ended up with something small, portable, wrapped—essentially a muffin. Same batter, completely different:
- Target buyers (coffee shops vs. restaurants)
- Competitors (donuts vs. desserts)
- Pricing (dollars vs. premium)
- Features to emphasize (portable vs. fancy ingredients)

**Cake Pop example:** A portable cake on a stick sounds like "Frankencake" positioned as cake. Positioned as "lollipop for grownups made from cake"—it makes sense.

### Trap 2: Market Changed, Positioning Didn't

Your position was perfect, but the market shifted.

**Example:** "Diet muffin" full of nuts, seeds, dates worked great for dieters. Then market shifted to paleo, gluten-free trends. Same product now better positioned as "gluten-free paleo snack" for bodybuilders and trendy moms.

## The Five Components in Detail

### 1. Competitive Alternatives

**Not what you think they are.**

Most startups worry about other startups competing for the same investors. But customers often don't know those startups exist. 

**Real alternatives are often:**
- Spreadsheets + manual processes
- Hiring an intern
- A combination of existing tools
- Doing nothing / living with the problem

**The question that reveals truth:** "What would you use if our product didn't exist?"

**Tip:** Focus only on what your *best-fit* customers see as alternatives. Edge cases don't matter.

### 2. Unique Attributes

**Must be provable.**

"Great customer service" and "easy to use" are claims everyone makes. What *evidence* supports these?

**Provable attributes:**
- Patented technology
- More support staff than competitors (provable)
- Certifications competitors lack
- Third-party reviews saying you're better
- Customer quotes confirming claims

**Include potential negatives:**
- "Requires professional services installation" could be negative (slower) or positive (high-touch, customization) depending on customer

### 3. Value (and Proof)

**The translation chain:**

| Level | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Feature | Patented fuzzy logic algorithm |
| Benefit | Faster response times |
| Value | Respond to customers while on the phone instead of calling back, improving satisfaction |

**Value = what they can DO because of your features.**

### 4. Target Market Characteristics

**Go deeper than firmographics.**

"Small businesses" is too broad. What *about* small businesses makes them care about your value?

**Better:** "Small businesses that send 50+ invoices per month" — they feel data entry pain acutely.

**Best-fit customers:**
- Understand immediately
- Buy quickly
- Don't negotiate hard on price
- Become advocates
- Tell you the product should cost MORE

**Sizing rule:** Can you hit this year's sales targets with just best-fit customers? If yes, stay narrow. If no, broaden slightly.

### 5. Market Category

**Triggers powerful assumptions.**

If you say "CRM," customers instantly assume:
- Your competitor is Salesforce
- You have contact, activity, opportunity management
- You charge monthly per user
- Pricing is similar to Salesforce

**Choose wisely.** These assumptions can work for you (no need to explain basics) or against you (expectations you can't meet).

**Example:** "Email for lawyers" triggered assumptions about calendar, mobile access that the product didn't have. Repositioned as "team collaboration software"—suddenly the file-sharing strength made sense and missing calendar didn't matter.

### (Bonus) Trends

**Trends ≠ Market Categories**

| Trend | Market Category |
|-------|-----------------|
| AI | AI-powered CRM |
| Blockchain | (not a category on its own) |
| DevOps | Database DevOps tools |
| Direct-to-consumer | Direct-to-consumer sampling |

**The three-circle test:**
- Your product's strengths
- Your market context  
- A relevant trend

You want the center where all three intersect.

**Warning examples:**
- "Sharing economy for pets" — trend without clear category
- "Uber for cats" — analogy without clarity
- "Long Blockchain" (iced tea company) — trend with no product connection, stock crashed

## Positioning Styles Deep Dive

### Style A: Head to Head

**When to use:**
- You're already the leader
- Market exists but no clear leader yet
- (Rare) Market is shifting in your favor

**When NOT to use:**
- You're a startup vs. established leader
- Without clear, defensible advantage

**Example of NOT doing this:**

Small database startup tried to position against Oracle. Every sales meeting: "How are you better than Oracle?" They couldn't answer convincingly. Oracle had:
- Proven solution with Fortune 1000 customers
- Thousands of features
- Famous CEO, conference keynotes, TV appearances

The startup was called "cheaper, crappier Siebel."

**The fix:** They stopped competing head to head. Found a subsegment (data warehousing) where their analytics strength mattered.

### Style B: Big Fish, Small Pond

**The power of focus:**

Janna Systems CRM example:
- Couldn't beat Siebel in enterprise CRM
- Had one feature Siebel lacked: relationship mapping between people
- Most customers didn't care about that feature
- Investment banks cared *intensely* (relationship-driven business)

**The pivot:**
- Repositioned as "CRM for investment banks"
- Used banking terminology, banking demo data
- Still compared to Siebel, but: "Best CRM for enterprises ≠ Best CRM for investment banks"
- Raised prices (banks don't expect commodity pricing)
- Grew from $2M to $70M in 18 months
- Acquired for $1.7 billion

**Key insight:** "Focusing on a niche doesn't mean you can't grow."

**Subsegment requirements:**
1. Category is well-defined with clear leader
2. Subsegment has clearly different needs
3. Subsegment is easily identifiable (can build a list)
4. You can meet those needs much better than the leader
5. Segment is big enough to hit your targets

**Warning:** Make sure the unmet need is real. Bic's "Bic for Her" (pink pens, same features) failed because women didn't have an unmet pen need.

### Style C: Create a New Game

**Most difficult style. Highest reward if successful.**

**When to consider:**
- Product genuinely doesn't fit any existing category
- Evaluated every possible category—none work
- You have resources for a long-term effort

**What it requires:**
- Teach market the *problem* exists first
- Teach how to evaluate solutions
- Position yourself as leader
- Defend that position as market grows

**Eloqua example:**

Started 2000 with chat for sales reps tracking website visitors. Added email marketing. Target buyers called themselves "demand generators" not "marketers."

- Called it "demand generation automation"
- Investors/analysts confused—didn't fit existing categories
- Thought market was too small

Then market shifted (~2005). Demand gen people proliferated. Eloqua's revenue grew.

2006: Repositioned from "demand generation automation" to "marketing automation" to:
- Make value more obvious
- Differentiate from simple email automation

**Results:** $12M (2006) → $96M (2012) → IPO → Acquired by Oracle for $870M

**Key insight:** "Category creation is hard, slow work, but if you are successful the rewards are huge."

**Warning:** Most common failure mode = building the market, then losing leadership to well-funded fast follower who swoops in.

## Extended Case Studies

### Case Study: Database → Data Warehouse

**The situation:**
- Startup built special database with fast query algorithm
- Positioned as "database"
- Constantly compared to Oracle
- Couldn't compete on breadth of features

**The insight:**
Customer said: "You're not really a database. You're more like a business intelligence tool—a data warehouse."

**The shift:**
- Repositioned as "data warehouse" 
- Analytics capabilities blew away other data warehouses
- Stopped being compared to Oracle
- Could charge premium pricing (warehouses aren't commodity)

### Case Study: Wave Accounting → Wave Financial Services

**The evolution:**
- Started as "Wave Accounting" for small business
- Added invoicing, payments, payroll
- Revenue model shifted from advertising to transaction fees

**The repositioning:**
- Dropped "Accounting" from name → just "Wave"
- Messaging: "managing business finances"
- Made it obvious they provide more than accounting

**Results:** Grew to 4+ million customers

### Case Study: Clearpath Robotics → OTTO Motors

**The problem:**
- Built robots that move around manufacturing plants intelligently
- Positioned as "robot"
- But their robots were nothing like traditional manufacturing robots (stationary, repetitive tasks)
- Had to explain away all the robot assumptions

**The insight:**
Their innovation = autonomous navigation. That's what self-driving cars do.

**The repositioning:**
- Created new division: OTTO Motors
- Designed products to look like vehicles (white "headlights," red "taillights")
- Website/materials looked like car manufacturer

**Results:** Sales accelerated, raised $30M, won Edison Awards

### Case Study: Wattpad → Entertainment Company

**The evolution:**
- Started 2006: social storytelling platform (read/write on phones)
- Grew with smartphone adoption
- By 2012: recognized they were creating valuable IP

**The test:**
- 2014: Philippines TV station wanted to create drama based on Wattpad stories
- "Wattpad Presents" increased station viewership by 30%
- Ran 4 seasons, 250 episodes

**The repositioning:**
- 2016: Unveiled "Wattpad Studios"
- Positioned as "global multi-platform entertainment company"
- Now works with NBC, Sony, Hulu, eOne

### Case Study: Sampler → Direct-to-Consumer Sampling

**The problem:**
- Sampler helps brands deliver targeted product samples
- Initially: "online product sampling"
- Confused brands about physical samples

**The insight:**
Big trends threatening consumer brands:
- Dollar Shave Club-style disruptors
- Amazon threatening to enter any category
- Brands investing in direct-to-consumer relationships

Sampler's value aligned perfectly with DTC initiatives.

**The repositioning:**
- Changed to "direct-to-consumer sampling"
- Explicit link to DTC trend

**Results:** Became priority purchase, deals closed faster. Now works with L'Oréal, Kimberly-Clark, Unilever.

### Case Study: Redgate Software → Database DevOps

**The situation:**
- Leader in database tools (monitoring, sync, privacy, automation)
- 800,000+ users
- Products seen as useful but not urgent/strategic/cool

**The approach:**
Didn't change market category (they're the leader). Layered on a trend.

**The insight:**
DevOps gaining popularity with their customers. Nobody talking about databases in DevOps transformation.

**The positioning:**
- Wove "database DevOps" into positioning
- Created content on data's role in DevOps
- Trained sales to consult on DevOps processes

**Results:** 
- 100% increase in inbound leads
- Dramatic increase in multi-product purchases
- Products became higher-priority purchases

## Workshop Facilitation Tips

### Getting Team Buy-in

1. **Business leader must drive it** — not marketing alone
2. **Include all functions** — each has different perspective
3. **Expose assumptions** — often different across teams
4. **Use external facilitator** — helps challenge sacred cows

### Common Workshop Challenges

**"But we've always been a [X]"**
- This is positioning baggage
- Product may have evolved beyond original vision
- Market may have changed

**"Our feature isn't that different"**
- Difference must be from *customer's* perspective
- Compare to what customers actually use, not what you track

**"Our market is too big to narrow"**
- You're not *eliminating* customers
- You're *prioritizing* best-fit customers
- Can always expand later

**"We don't have any trends"**
- Trends are optional
- Many successful products are "boring"
- Better boring and clear than trendy and confusing

## Quotes from "Obviously Awesome"

> "Positioning is the act of deliberately defining how you are the best at something that a defined market cares a lot about."

> "Weak positioning diminishes the results of everything we do in marketing and sales."

> "We generally fail to deliberately choose a context because we believe that the context for our product is obvious."

> "The features of our product and the value they provide are only unique, interesting and valuable when a customer perceives them in relation to alternatives."

> "Your best-fit customers hold the key to understanding what your product is."

> "Target as narrowly as you can to meet your near-term sales objectives. You can broaden the targets later."

> "Category creation is about selling the market on the problem first, rather than on your solution."

> "It's always better to be a little boring than completely baffling."
