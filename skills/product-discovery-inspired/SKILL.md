description: Validate product ideas before building using INSPIRED methodology. Use when you need to test if customers will buy/use something, if users can figure it out, if engineers can build it, and if it works for the business. Say "run product discovery on [idea]" or "validate this solution using INSPIRED approach."

# Product Discovery (INSPIRED Method)

Rapidly validate whether a product idea is worth building by addressing four critical risks BEFORE writing production code.

## When to Use

- **Before committing to building** a new feature or product
- **When stakeholders push for feature** - need to validate it solves real problem
- **When team has objective to achieve** - discovering best solution
- **Before making high-integrity commitment** - must validate solution works
- **When roadmap item reaches top of backlog** - pause to discover right solution

## Core Principle

> "The goal of product discovery is to address these critical risks: Will the customer buy this, or choose to use it? (Value) Can the user figure out how to use it? (Usability) Can we build it? (Feasibility) Does this solution work for our business? (Viability)"

**The shift:** Validate ideas FAST and CHEAP before building SLOW and EXPENSIVE.

## The Four Risks to Address

### 1. Value Risk
**Question:** Will customers buy this, or choose to use it?

**Why it matters:** At least half of ideas just won't work—customers not excited, not willing to switch, don't see value

**How to test:**
- Customer interviews (qualitative)
- Demand testing (fake door, landing page)
- Live-data prototype with real users
- A/B tests (if have traffic)

### 2. Usability Risk
**Question:** Can users figure out how to use it?

**Why it matters:** Product might be valuable but too complicated; users give up

**How to test:**
- User prototypes (clickable mockups)
- Usability testing (watch users try to use it)
- Think-aloud protocol
- Time on task, error rates

### 3. Feasibility Risk
**Question:** Can we build it with the time, skills, and technology we have?

**Why it matters:** Idea might cost way more than expected; technical constraints might block it

**How to test:**
- Feasibility prototypes (spike code)
- Technical investigation
- Architecture review
- Build time estimates AFTER understanding solution

### 4. Business Viability Risk
**Question:** Does this solution work for sales, marketing, finance, legal, etc.?

**Why it matters:** Solution might work for customers but not work for our business model, legal constraints, go-to-market approach

**How to test:**
- Stakeholder review of prototype
- Business model canvas
- Monetization testing
- Sales/marketing/legal review

## The Discovery Process

### Phase 1: Frame the Problem

**Inputs:**
- Business objective or problem to solve
- Context: vision, strategy, constraints

**Activities:**
- **Opportunity Assessment** - Articulate problem, success metrics, target customers, solution ideas
- **Customer Letter** - Write future press release from customer perspective
- **Startup Canvas** - Map business model assumptions

**Output:** Clear problem statement, success criteria, initial hypotheses

**Time:** 1-2 days

### Phase 2: Plan Discovery

**Inputs:**
- Problem framing
- Understanding of users/customers

**Activities:**
- **Story Mapping** - Map user journey and features needed
- **Customer Discovery Program** - Identify customers to learn from regularly

**Output:** Discovery plan, customer access arranged

**Time:** 2-3 days

### Phase 3: Ideate Solutions

**Inputs:**
- Problem framing
- Customer insights

**Activities:**
- **Customer Interviews** - Deep qualitative learning (problems, context, workflows)
- **Concierge Testing** - Manually deliver solution to learn
- **Hack Days** - Engineer-driven innovation time
- **Team brainstorming** - PM + Designer + Engineers together

**Output:** Multiple solution concepts to prototype

**Time:** Ongoing, weekly customer interviews

### Phase 4: Prototype Solutions

**Inputs:**
- Solution concepts
- Risks to address

**Activities:**
- **Feasibility Prototypes** - Engineers spike code to test technical approach
- **User Prototypes** - Designers create clickable mockups
- **Live-Data Prototypes** - Working prototype with real backend data
- **Hybrid Prototypes** - Combination approach

**Output:** Testable prototypes for each risk type

**Time:** 1-5 days per prototype (depends on complexity and risk type)

### Phase 5: Test with Customers & Stakeholders

**Inputs:**
- Prototypes
- Target users/customers
- Success criteria

**Activities:**

**For Value:**
- Demand testing (will they sign up?)
- Qualitative value testing (interviews with prototype)
- Quantitative value testing (A/B test, cohort analysis)

**For Usability:**
- Usability testing (can they complete tasks?)
- Time on task measurement
- Error rate tracking

**For Feasibility:**
- Technical review of feasibility prototype
- Architecture assessment
- Performance/scale validation

**For Viability:**
- Stakeholder prototype review
- Business model validation
- Legal/compliance check

**Output:** Evidence that solution works (or doesn't) for each risk

**Time:** 1-2 weeks for validation (faster for high-confidence ideas)

### Phase 6: Iterate or Commit

**Decision point:** Did we address all four risks?

**If NO:** Iterate solution based on learnings, return to prototype/test phases

**If YES:** Make high-integrity commitment to build it

**Evidence needed:**
- ✅ Customers demonstrated they want it (value)
- ✅ Users could successfully use it (usability)
- ✅ Engineers confident they can build it (feasibility)
- ✅ Stakeholders approve business model (viability)

## Key Principles

### 1. Collaborate, Don't Hand Off
- **Anti-pattern:** PM writes requirements → Designer designs → Engineer builds
- **Right way:** PM + Designer + Engineer work together throughout
- Engineers involved from start (best source of innovation)
- Designer shapes solution continuously
- PM brings customer/business context

### 2. Fast and Cheap Over Slow and Expensive
- **Prototype, don't build production code** (10x-100x faster)
- **Test with 5-8 users** for usability (don't need 100)
- **Fake it before you make it** (manual Concierge test)
- **Iterate rapidly** based on learnings

### 3. Evidence Over Opinions
- **Don't debate** whether customers will want it
- **Show them prototype** and observe their reaction
- **Measure** actual behavior (clicks, sign-ups, usage)
- **Data + customer insights** trump opinions

### 4. Address Risks in Parallel
- Don't wait to test feasibility until after design
- Designer works on user prototype while engineer tests feasibility
- PM coordinates and tests value/viability
- **Goal:** All four risks addressed before commitment

### 5. Embrace the Inconvenient Truths
- **Truth #1:** At least half of ideas won't work (3/4 for good teams)
- **Truth #2:** Working ideas need several iterations
- This is normal and expected
- Discovery process designed for this reality

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Discovery Without Engineers
**Problem:** Missing best source of innovation and can't test feasibility  
**Fix:** Engineers participate in discovery (not just coding)

### ❌ Discovery Without Customers
**Problem:** Building based on assumptions, not reality  
**Fix:** Weekly customer touchpoints, not quarterly research

### ❌ High-Fidelity Too Soon
**Problem:** Expensive to change, slows iteration  
**Fix:** Start with sketches, move to clickable prototypes, then higher fidelity only when validated

### ❌ Testing Only One Risk
**Problem:** Might be usable but no value, or valuable but can't build  
**Fix:** Address all four risks before committing

### ❌ Discovery Theater
**Problem:** Going through motions but not really testing  
**Fix:** Must get genuine evidence, not just check boxes

### ❌ Endless Discovery
**Problem:** Never committing because there's always more to learn  
**Fix:** Set discovery time box, make decision with evidence you have

## Discovery at Different Stages

### Startup (Pre-Product/Market Fit)
- **Focus:** Finding product/market fit
- **Cycle:** Very fast iteration (days to week)
- **Risk priority:** Value risk first (will anyone want this?)
- **Team:** Founders doing discovery

### Growth Stage
- **Focus:** New features for proven product
- **Cycle:** 1-2 week discovery sprints
- **Risk priority:** All four risks important
- **Team:** Product manager leads with team

### Enterprise
- **Focus:** Innovation within constraints
- **Cycle:** 2-4 week discovery sprints
- **Risk priority:** Viability risk critical (many stakeholders)
- **Team:** PM coordinates across multiple stakeholders

## Success Criteria

**Discovery succeeded when:**
- ✅ Team has evidence (not opinions) about all four risks
- ✅ Solution validated with real target customers
- ✅ Engineers confident in build approach and timeline
- ✅ Stakeholders approved business model/approach
- ✅ Team ready to make high-integrity commitment

**Discovery failed when:**
- ❌ Ideas tested but none worked (learning—try different approach)
- ❌ Can't get customer access (need different discovery approach)
- ❌ Too expensive/time-consuming to build (pivot or de-prioritize)
- ❌ Doesn't work for business (find different solution)

**Important:** Discovery "failure" is actually success—you learned BEFORE wasting months building wrong thing.

## Integration with Delivery

### Discovery and Delivery Run in Parallel

**Discovery team activities:**
- Testing next week's ideas
- 1-2 weeks ahead of delivery

**Delivery team activities:**
- Building last week's validated ideas
- Continuous deployment

**Handoff:**
- High-integrity commitment made
- Specs: Working prototype + validation evidence
- Engineers build production-quality version

### The Discovery/Delivery Balance

**Too much discovery, not enough delivery:**
- Analysis paralysis
- Team frustrated, nothing shipping
- Stakeholders lose confidence

**Too much delivery, not enough discovery:**
- Building wrong things
- Waste (the Lean sin)
- Lots shipping, nothing working

**Right balance:**
- Steady stream of validated ideas feeding delivery
- Continuous learning from shipped product
- Roughly 1:4 ratio (1 week discovery → 4 weeks delivery)

## When to Use This Skill

**Perfect for:**
- ✅ New feature ideas that need validation
- ✅ Solving business objectives (OKR-driven work)
- ✅ Pivoting from failing solution
- ✅ Exploring new markets/personas
- ✅ High-risk, high-value opportunities

**Not needed for:**
- ❌ Obvious bug fixes
- ❌ Performance optimization (technical debt)
- ❌ Copy changes, minor tweaks
- ❌ Legal/compliance requirements (must-dos)

## Quick Start

**For your next feature request:**

1. **Pause** - Don't start building yet
2. **Frame** - What problem are we solving? For whom? How do we measure success?
3. **Ideate** - Brainstorm solutions with team (PM+Designer+Engineers)
4. **Prototype** - Create cheapest testable version
5. **Test** - Show to 5-8 target customers, observe reactions
6. **Iterate or commit** - If it works, commit to build; if not, iterate

**Time investment:** 1-2 weeks discovery saves 2-3 months building wrong thing

**Remember:** The goal of discovery is to address risks BEFORE building, not to perfectly design the solution. Good enough evidence to make informed commitment is the bar.
