# The 12 Cognitive Secrets

Detailed breakdown of each principle from "Wired for Story" with examples.

## 1. We Think in Story

**The Science:** The brain evolved to process experience through narrative. Story is how we make sense of raw input, not a luxury add-on.

**Implication:** From the first sentence, the reader must want to know what happens next.

**How to Apply:**
- Start with a ball already in play
- Hint that something is changing
- Create the sense of "all is not as it seems"

**Example:**
- ❌ "Today I want to talk about our journey building WidgetCorp..."
- ✅ "The morning I fired my best friend, I realized I'd been building the wrong company."

## 2. The Brain Filters for Relevance

**The Science:** Of the millions of bits of information hitting us every second, we consciously process only a handful. The brain uses relevance to the current goal as its filter.

**Implication:** Everything in a story must be there on a need-to-know basis.

**How to Apply:**
- Apply the "And So?" test to every detail
- If something doesn't serve the story question, cut it
- Digressions kill momentum

**Example:**
- ❌ "She had a red Toyota Corolla, which she'd bought in 2019 after her old Honda finally gave out."
- ✅ "She sat in her car for twenty minutes before she could walk back into the office." (Only mention the car if it matters)

## 3. Emotion Determines Meaning

**The Science:** The brain doesn't process anything neutrally. Everything is automatically coated in emotion to determine: "Does this help me or hurt me?"

**Implication:** All story is emotion-based. If we're not feeling, we're not reading.

**How to Apply:**
- Show the protagonist's reaction to every significant event
- Internal reactions > external descriptions
- Body language can reveal true feelings

**Example:**
- ❌ "We lost the deal."
- ✅ "We lost the deal. I hung up and sat there, watching my cursor blink on a blank screen for what must have been ten minutes."

## 4. Everything Is Goal-Directed

**The Science:** The brain evolved to read other people's intentions for survival. We're constantly trying to figure out what everyone wants.

**Implication:** A protagonist without a clear goal has nothing to figure out and nowhere to go.

**How to Apply:**
- Define EXTERNAL goal (what they're trying to achieve)
- Define INTERNAL goal (what achieving it means to them)
- These are often in tension

**Example:**
```
EXTERNAL: Build a $100M company
INTERNAL: Prove that leaving Goldman wasn't a mistake
```

## 5. We See What We Believe

**The Science:** Our beliefs filter everything we perceive. We don't see the world as it is—we see it as we believe it to be.

**Implication:** You must know precisely when and why the protagonist's worldview was knocked out of alignment.

**How to Apply:**
- Identify the "origin wound" that created the misbelief
- Show how this misbelief colors their interpretation of events
- The story forces them to confront this misbelief

**Example:**
```
ORIGIN WOUND: Father's business failed when protagonist was 12
MISBELIEF: "If you don't control everything, you'll lose everything"
STORY: Forces them to trust their team, delegate, let go
```

## 6. We Think in Images, Not Abstractions

**The Science:** Abstract concepts don't activate the brain the same way concrete images do. "If you can't picture it, it's too general."

**Implication:** Anything conceptual must be made tangible through specific details.

**How to Apply:**
- Replace every abstraction with a concrete image
- Use the test: Can I see this in my mind?
- Sensory details only if they serve the story

**Examples:**

| Abstract | Specific |
|----------|----------|
| "The startup years were hard" | "We shared a studio apartment for two years. I slept on an air mattress that slowly deflated every night." |
| "She was devastated" | "She found herself standing in the grocery store, holding a can of soup, crying" |
| "I learned about leadership" | "The first time I had to fire someone, my hands shook so badly I spilled coffee on my shirt" |

## 7. The Brain Resists Change

**The Science:** The brain's primary goal is maintaining stable equilibrium. Change—even good change—registers as threatening.

**Implication:** Story is about change that results only from unavoidable conflict.

**How to Apply:**
- Create "versus" tensions that force change
- Make the status quo untenable
- Change must cost something

**Versus Tensions:**
- What they believe vs. what's actually true
- What they want vs. what they have
- What they want vs. what's expected of them
- Their fear vs. their goal
- Internal goal vs. external goal

---

## 8. The Brain Craves Causality

**The Science:** From birth, our brain's primary goal is making causal connections—"if this, then that."

**Implication:** A story follows a cause-and-effect trajectory from start to finish.

**How to Apply:**
- Every scene: Action → Reaction → Decision
- The decision in one scene triggers the action in the next
- Nothing happens "just because"

**Example Structure:**
```
ACTION: They lose their biggest customer
REACTION: Panic, self-doubt, fear of telling the team
DECISION: To be transparent with the team rather than hide it
NEW ACTION: All-hands meeting where they share the news
```

## 9. Stories Are Survival Simulations

**The Science:** The brain uses stories to simulate how we might navigate difficult situations without actually living through them.

**Implication:** A story's job is to put the protagonist through tests that, even in their wildest dreams, they don't think they can pass.

**How to Apply:**
- Make things worse, not better
- Force them to face their deepest fear
- No free passes, no easy victories
- Everything must be earned

**The Suffering Rule:** If the protagonist hasn't suffered, they haven't been tested. If they haven't been tested, they haven't grown. If they haven't grown, there's no story.

## 10. The Brain Hunts for Patterns

**The Science:** The brain constantly converts raw data into meaningful patterns to anticipate what might happen next.

**Implication:** Readers are always on the lookout for patterns. Everything is either a setup, a payoff, or the road in between.

**How to Apply:**
- Every setup needs a payoff
- Every payoff needs a setup
- Don't plant details that go nowhere
- Don't resolve things that weren't set up

**Rules:**
1. The setup can't piggyback on the payoff (no "oh by the way, here's the solution to the problem I just mentioned")
2. The reader must see the road unfold
3. The payoff must be logistically possible

---

## 11. Memory Serves the Present

**The Science:** We summon past memories to evaluate what's happening in the moment. Memory evolved to serve current decisions, not nostalgia.

**Implication:** Flashbacks and backstory must instantly give readers insight into what's happening in the main storyline.

**How to Apply:**
- Every flashback needs a present-moment trigger
- We must understand why this memory matters NOW
- Backstory should change how we interpret the current scene

**Test:** After the flashback, does the reader see the present differently?

---

## 12. Skill Requires Conscious Practice

**The Science:** It takes long-term conscious effort to hone a skill before the brain assigns it to the cognitive unconscious (where it becomes "intuitive").

**Implication:** There's no writing; there's only rewriting.

**How to Apply:**
- First drafts are supposed to be bad
- Rewrite to discover what you're actually writing about
- Get outside feedback (you know too much about your own story)
- 10-15 drafts is not unusual for professional writers

**Quote from Hemingway:** "All first drafts are shit."
