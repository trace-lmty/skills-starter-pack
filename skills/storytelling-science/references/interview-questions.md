Getting concrete images instead of abstractions.

- "Take me to a specific moment—what were you doing, where were you, what did it look like?"

- "What were you eating/wearing/listening to?"

### Emotional Texture
Getting reactions, not just events.

- "What did you do right after?"
- "What was your body doing?" (physical manifestations of emotion)
- "What's the part you don't usually tell people?"

## Follow-Up Probes

When answers are too abstract:

- "Can you give me a specific example?"
- "What did that actually look like day-to-day?"
- "When you say [abstract term], what do you mean specifically?"

- "What's a story that illustrates that?"

When answers are too surface:

- "Why did that matter so much?"
- "What was underneath that?"
- "What were you really afraid of?"
- "What would it have meant if [X]?"
- "How does that connect to [earlier thing they mentioned]?"
