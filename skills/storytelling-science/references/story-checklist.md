# Story Quality Checklist

Pre-publication verification for narrative content.

---

## Core Story Requirements

### ✅ Protagonist Check
- [ ] One clear protagonist (POV is consistent)
- [ ] We know what they want externally
- [ ] We know what they want internally (what it MEANS to them)
- [ ] Their goal drives the narrative

### ✅ Stakes Check
- [ ] We know what failure would cost
- [ ] Something is at risk throughout
- [ ] The stakes escalate as the story progresses

### ✅ Conflict/Versus Check
- [ ] There's clear tension between opposing forces
- [ ] The protagonist faces genuine obstacles
- [ ] They must confront something they'd rather avoid

### ✅ Transformation Check
- [ ] The protagonist changes through the story
- [ ] Their worldview shifts
- [ ] We understand who they were BEFORE vs. AFTER
- [ ] The change was EARNED through struggle

---

## Structural Checks

### ✅ Opening
- [ ] Ball already in play (no preamble)
- [ ] Something happening, not just setup
- [ ] Reader wants to know what happens next
- [ ] Sense that "all is not as it seems"

### ✅ Cause & Effect
- [ ] Each beat logically leads to the next
- [ ] Nothing happens "just because"
- [ ] Decisions lead to consequences

### ✅ Setup/Payoff
- [ ] Every setup has a payoff
- [ ] Every payoff was set up
- [ ] No orphan details (mentioned but never matter)
- [ ] No deus ex machina (sudden solutions from nowhere)

### ✅ Pacing
- [ ] Conflict builds, doesn't plateau
- [ ] Breathers are intentional, not accidental
- [ ] Things get worse before they get better

---

## Detail Checks

### ✅ Specificity
- [ ] No abstract lessons without concrete examples
- [ ] Details are visual (can picture them)
- [ ] Emotions shown through action, not just stated
- [ ] Abstractions like "hard" or "learned" are illustrated

### ✅ Relevance ("And So?" Test)
- [ ] Every detail serves the story
- [ ] Digressions eliminated
- [ ] No tangents that don't connect
- [ ] Background only if it illuminates NOW

### ✅ Reactions
- [ ] We see how events affect the protagonist
- [ ] Internal responses visible, not just external events
- [ ] Body language/behavior reveals feelings
- [ ] No event passes without reaction

---

## Voice Checks

### ✅ Authenticity
- [ ] Sounds like a real person, not a press release
- [ ] Specific language, not corporate-speak
- [ ] Vulnerability present (not just wins)
- [ ] Personality comes through

### ✅ Consistency
- [ ] Voice matches throughout
- [ ] Tone appropriate to the content
- [ ] No jarring shifts

---

## Common Failure Modes

**Check for these and fix if present:**

### ❌ Events Without Reactions
"We launched. Then we raised money. Then we hired."
→ Must show how each event AFFECTED the protagonist

### ❌ Abstract Lessons
"I learned a lot about leadership."
→ Must give specific, concrete insight

### ❌ Happy Path Narrative
Everything works out with minor bumps.
→ Must show genuine struggle, real cost

### ❌ Missing Internal Goal
Only external goals mentioned.
→ Must show what success MEANS to them

### ❌ Starting Too Early
"I was born in Ohio..."
→ Must start when world is about to change

### ❌ Telling Not Showing
"He was nervous." / "She was devastated."
→ Must show through action/behavior/dialogue

### ❌ The Vanishing Protagonist
Events happen but protagonist isn't affected.
→ Every beat must filter through protagonist's experience

### ❌ Resolution Without Struggle
Problem solved easily, no real test.
→ Victory must be earned through crucible

## Final Review Questions

Before publishing, ask:

1. **If I remove the protagonist, does the story still work?**
   - If yes, the protagonist isn't doing enough work. The story is about events, not a person.

2. **Could this story happen to anyone?**
   - If yes, it's too generic. Must be specific to THIS person.

3. **Does the reader know why this matters?**
   - If they need to be told "this is important," you haven't shown why.

4. **Does the protagonist change?**
   - If not, it's a report, not a story.

5. **Did they earn the ending?**
   - If the struggle wasn't hard enough, the victory feels hollow.

## Quick Reference: The Core Test

A complete story must have:

1. **A protagonist** we can see through
2. **A goal** (external and internal)
3. **Stakes** (cost of failure)
4. **Conflict** (versus tensions)
5. **Struggle** (things get harder)
6. **Transformation** (they change)
7. **Causality** (each beat leads to the next)
8. **Specificity** (we can picture it)

If any element is missing, the story is incomplete.
